  <title>Light</title>
  

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Light is a form of energy. It excites the sensation of vision when strikes 
      the eye retina. To see things around we need not only eye but also the presence 
      of light is very important. A blind person can not see anything even if the room is 
      full of light just as a normal person can not see anything if room is completely dark. 
      Light coming from an object when falls on the surface of eye retina we can see that object. 
      Even though light helps us see things around light itself is invisible. However, we divide 
      light into two categories such as visible light and invisible light. It is not because 
      we can or can not see the light rather it is based on the sensation of vision. 
      Light which can help sensation of vision is called visible light and that which which 
      can not stimulate the sensation of vision is known as invisble light. Light is an electromagnetic 
      radiation which consists of the ranges of waves from gamma rays to radio waves (<xref ref="emspectrum"/>). 
      The so called visible light is a very small portion of an electromagnetic radiation.

    <title>Speed of Light</title>
    <p>
      Before <m>17^{th}</m> century, velocity of light was thought to be infinite because of 
      the fact that the flash of lightening is seen instantly and the sound is heard after 
      some time. According to Newton a luminous object continuously emits streams of particles, 
      called <term>corpuscles</term>. Corpuscles are tiny, light, and elastic in nature which travel 
      in a straight line  with very high velocities and can pass through interstices of the 
      particles of matter and posses the property of reflection and transmission. The first 
      unsuccessful attempt to find the velocity of light was made by Galileo in 1600. In 1679, 
      Christian Huygens proposed the wave nature of light. In 1873 James Clerk Maxwell predicted 
      the electromagnetic waves  and calculated speed of light in vacuum by using formula 
      <me>
        c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{o}\mu_{o}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(8.85\times10^{-12}C^{2}/Nm^{2})(4\pi\times10^{-7}N/A^{2})}} \approx 3.00\times10^{8}\,m/s
      </me>
    where <m>\epsilon_{o}</m> is electric permitivitty and <m>\mu_{o}</m> is magnetic permeability of vacuum.

    <title>Huygens's Principle</title>
    <p>
      According to Huygens, a source of light sends out waves in all directions, through a 
      hypothetical medium called <em>ether</em>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="Wfront">

  <p>
    Consider a source, S as shown in <xref ref="Wfront"/>(a) which is sending out light in the 
    form of waves in all directions. If v be the velocity of  propagation of the wave then at 
    time, t, all the particles of the medium on the surface, xy will be vibrating in phase. Hence, 
    xy is a portion of the sphere of radius, vt with center, S. The surface, xy is called a wavefront. 
    A <term>wavefront</term> is a locus of all the points of the medium which are vibrating in 
    phase in every interval of time. If the distance is small then wavefront takes shape of a 
    source such as point source emits spherical wavefronts and line source emits cylindrical 
    wavefronts but if the source is at a large distance, then any small portion of the 
    wavefront can be considered as plane wavefront as shown in <xref ref="Wfront"/>(b). 
    The radius of wavefront is considered as ray of light. Thus rays of light diverging 
    from or converging to a point give rise to a spherical wavefront and a parallel beam 
    of light gives rise to a plane wavefront. According to Huygens, every point on the  
    primary wavefront (1, 2, 3, etc.,) behaves as the secondary source of light. 
    These secondary waves are called wavelets that travel in space with the same velocity 
    as the original wave and the envelope of the all the secondary wavelets after given 
    interval of time gives rise to a secondary wavefront. As the secondary wavelets are 
    spherical  this would lead to backward propagation of the wave. In time, t' the 
    secondary waves travel a distance, vt' with points (1, 2, 3, etc.) being their centers. 
    Hence the envelope <m>x_{1}y_{1}</m> is a secondary wavefront and  <m>x_{2}y_{2}</m> is 
    a backward wavefront. Now according to Huygens principle only  forward wavefronts 
    are plausible not the backward wavefront. The rear envelope of these wavelets is shown 
    by <m>x_{2}y_{2}</m> which cannot represent the next wavefront after the time, t. 
    This can be explained using Stoke's law. According to this law, the amplitude at each point 
    of the secondary wave is proportional to <m>(1+\cos\theta)</m> where <m>\theta </m> 
    is the angle between the wave normal (<m>Sx </m> or, <m> Sy</m>) and the direction of 
    propagation which is the line, joining the point of the secondary wave to its centre. 
    For the backward wavefront, <m>\theta=\pi</m>. 
    <me>
      \therefore \quad (1+\cos\theta) =(1+\cos\pi) =0.
    </me>
     Hence no effect of secondary wavelets is observed in the backward direction because amplitude is zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    The nature of light described by Newton's corpuscular theory and Huygens wave theory both have some 
    drawbacks. Corpuscular theory explained somehow the phenomenon of reflection and transmission 
    but unable to explain many observed phenomena such as interference, diffraction, and double refraction. 
    Similarly Huygens idea explained about reflection, double refraction, transmission, interference, 
    and diffraction but unable to explain some other phenomena such as polarization and photoelectric effect. 
    After Fresnel suggestion that the light wave is rather transverse in nature than a longitudinal, 
    polarization can be explained satisfactorily. It also predicted that the velocity of light is 
    slower in optically denser medium which was not the case in Newton's corpuscular theory. 
    When Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect the presence of ether medium in 1887 the concept of ether was abandoned.

    The photoelectric effect introduced evidence that light exhibited particle properties on the quantum scale. 
    The particle properties of electrons was well documented when  DeBroglie hypothesis and Davidson 
    and Germer experiment established the wave nature of electron. Hence quantum view of light rely 
    on dual nature of light. However, for ordinary optics the wave view of light is the practical approach.
