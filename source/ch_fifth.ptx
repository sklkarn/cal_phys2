      It is a branch of physics which deals with the property, propagation, emission, and nature of light. 
      It is divided into parts, geometric optics and physical optics. In geometrical optics 
      we learn about the reflection, refraction, and dispersion of light by considering the 
      rectilinear propagation of light using ray diagrams. In physical optics we learn about interference, 
      diffraction, and polarization of light by considering its wave nature.
