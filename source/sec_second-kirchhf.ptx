  <p>
    On the basis of conservation principle Gustav Kirchhoff established two laws 
    to solve the complicated electrical circuits (or networks of conductors).

        <term>I Law:</term> It is also called a <em>current law</em>. This law is based on the principle 
        of conservation of charge. It states that in an electrical circuit the algebraic sum of 
        currents at a point is zero, i.e., the currents entering to a point is equal to currents 
        going out of the point as shown in <xref ref="currentlaw"/>. Mathematically, 
        <men xml:id="eqn-kirch1">
          \sum I=0

        \text{or,}\quad I_{5}+I_{6}-I_{1}-I_{2}-I_{3}-I_{4}=0
      </me>
      <me>
        i.e., \quad I_{1}+I_{2}+I_{3}+I_{4}=I_{5}+I_{6}
      </me>
      Thus in an electrical circuit, there is no accumulation of charge at any point or junction.
      </p>
  <p>
    <term>Junction or Node:</term> It is a point in a network where two or more than two 
    circuit elements meet together as points <m>A,\, B, \,P,</m> or <m>Q</m> in <xref ref="voltlaw"/>. 
    Points A, H, and D are the same point or the same junction. It is a shared point between 
    electrical components. The voltage at any point on the junction is same.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Loop:</term> It is a closed circuit along which a current can flow. 
    The closed circuit ABCDA is one loop, ABGHA is another loop, and DCGHD is 
    the other loop as shown in <xref ref="voltlaw"/>.
  </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <term> II Law:</term> It is also called a <em>voltage law</em>. 
       It states that in a closed loop of electrical circuit total voltage is equal to zero, 
       i.e., in a closed loop of an electrical circuit the algebraic sum of electromotive forces 
       is equal to the potential drop at circuit elements (resistances) as shown in <xref ref="voltlaw"/>.  
       Mathematically,

      <me>
        \text{or,} \quad \sum E = \sum IR

               For a closed loop ABGHA, 
               <me>
                E_{1}-E_{2}=I_{1}R_{1} - I_{2}R_{2}

               For a closed loop ABCDA, 
               <me>
                E_{2}=(I_{1}+I_{2})R_{3} + I_{2}R_{2}
               </me>
             For a closed loop HGCDH,
             <me>
              E_{1} =  (I_{1}+I_{2})R_{3}+I_{1}R_{1}
             </me>

         all currents flow in the loop are in same direction.

  <title>Analysis of DC Electric Circuit</title>
  <p>
    To analyze an electric circuit by using Kirchhoff's law the following sign convention 
    is adopted for current to find the total emf and voltage drop at arm in a loop. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider a hypothetical current flowing in a loop in any direction, if the real current 
    of the battery or any other current from neighboring loop is opposing this hypothetical 
    current give - ve sign for the emf of a battery or neighboring current otherwise give + ve sign. 
    Remember battery emits current only from its positive terminal. See the following circuit analysis as an example -

        In loop I [<m>I_1</m> is +ve], hence <m>I_2</m> and <m>E_2</m> are taken as -ve as they oppose the current <m>I_1</m>.

  <title>Wheat-Stone's Bridge Circuit</title>
  <p>
    Wheat-stone's bridge circuit is shown in <xref ref="wheatst"/>. 
    It has four resistances arranged in four arms of the circuit. In this bridge,
     potential at points B and D is so arranged with the help of P, Q, and R resistances 
     that no current will pass through the galvanometer. The bridge with zero <m> I_{g}</m> is known as balanced bridge.

  <term>Note: </term> Here current cycle is taken along <m>I_{1},</m> so any other current

             Since Wheat-stone bridge is used at balanced condtion no current should pass 
             through the Galvanometer, i.e.,

              I_1+I_2=0

    Charging and discharging of a capacitor circuit is shown in <xref ref="chrdis"/>. 
    Let us consider a capacitor (c) is completely discharged at <m>t = 0</m> when 
    swich (k) is open. Now as the switch, k is closed to point 1, current begins to 
    flow into the capacitor via resistor, R and capacitor begins charging gradually. 
    Here resistor, R is needed in a circuit to slow down a charging or discharging process to protect capacitor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage law to the charging loop, we have 
    <me>
      E=V_{R}+V_{c} = iR+\frac{q}{C}, 
    </me>
    where <m>E</m> is emf of a battery, <m>V_{R}</m> is a potential drop at resistance <m>R</m>, 
    <m> V_{c}</m> is a potential across the capacitor, <m>C</m> is capacitance of the capacitor, <m>q</m> 
    is the charge stored in the capacitor at any time <m> t,</m> and <m>i</m> is a changing current 
    in a circuit with time.

    <me>
      \text{or,}\quad \frac{\,dq}{EC-q}=\frac{\,dt}{RC}

    Integrating, we get -

    Here <m>EC=q_{o},</m> is the maximum charge this capacitor can hold.

      \therefore \quad q(t)= q_{o}\left[1-e^{(-\frac{t}{RC})}\right] 
    </men>
   This is the charge stored in a capacitor at any time t.
  </p> 
  <p>
Since, <m>q(t)=CV_{c}(t)</m> and <m>q_{o}=EC</m>, we have -
<men xml:id="eqn-chrg_dis2">
  V_{c}(t)=E\left(1-e^{(-\frac{t}{RC})}\right)

Now, differentiate eqn. <xref ref="eqn-chrg_dis1"/> with respect to time t, we get- 
<me>
  \frac{dq}{dt}=-q_{o}e^{(-\frac{t}{RC})}\left(-\frac{1}{RC}\right) = \frac{q_{o}}{RC}e^{(-\frac{t}{RC})}

where <m>\frac{q_{o}}{RC}=I_{o},</m> the maximum current in a circuit.

<p>
When switch k is connected to the point 2, capacitor statrs discharging. 
Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law to the discharging loop, we have -

Differentiating eqn. <xref ref="eqn-chrg_dis4"/>, we get-

- ve  sign indicates current is decreasing gradually during discharging of a capacitor. 
<m>RC=\tau</m> is called a time constant. The graph of charging and discharging of a
