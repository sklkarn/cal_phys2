  <title>Kirchhoff's Law</title>
  
<introduction>
  <p>
    On the basis of conservation principle Gustav Kirchhoff established two laws 
    to solve the complicated electrical circuits (or networks of conductors).

        <term>I Law:</term> It is also called a <em>current law</em>. This law is based on the principle 
        of conservation of charge. It states that in an electrical circuit the algebraic sum of 
        currents at a point is zero, i.e., the currents entering to a point is equal to currents 
        going out of the point as shown in <xref ref="currentlaw"/>. Mathematically, 
        <men xml:id="eqn-kirch1">
          \sum I=0
        </men>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad I_{5}+I_{6}-I_{1}-I_{2}-I_{3}-I_{4}=0
      </me>
      <me>
        i.e., \quad I_{1}+I_{2}+I_{3}+I_{4}=I_{5}+I_{6}
      </me>
      Thus in an electrical circuit, there is no accumulation of charge at any point or junction.
      </p>
  <p>
    <term>Junction or Node:</term> It is a point in a network where two or more than two 
    circuit elements meet together as points <m>A,\, B, \,P,</m> or <m>Q</m> in <xref ref="voltlaw"/>. 
    Points A, H, and D are the same point or the same junction. It is a shared point between 
    electrical components. The voltage at any point on the junction is same.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Loop:</term> It is a closed circuit along which a current can flow. 
    The closed circuit ABCDA is one loop, ABGHA is another loop, and DCGHD is 
    the other loop as shown in <xref ref="voltlaw"/>.
  </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <term> II Law:</term> It is also called a <em>voltage law</em>. 
       It states that in a closed loop of electrical circuit total voltage is equal to zero, 
       i.e., in a closed loop of an electrical circuit the algebraic sum of electromotive forces 
       is equal to the potential drop at circuit elements (resistances) as shown in <xref ref="voltlaw"/>.  
       Mathematically, 
      <men xml:id="eqn-kirch2">
        \sum V = 0
      </men>
      <me>
        \text{or,} \quad \sum E = \sum IR
      </me>
               For a closed loop ABGHA, 
               <me>
                E_{1}-E_{2}=I_{1}R_{1} - I_{2}R_{2}
               </me>
               For a closed loop ABCDA, 
               <me>
                E_{2}=(I_{1}+I_{2})R_{3} + I_{2}R_{2}
               </me>
             For a closed loop HGCDH,
             <me>
              E_{1} =  (I_{1}+I_{2})R_{3}+I_{1}R_{1}
             </me>
         Remember, the voltage drop or emf will be added up if 
         all currents flow in the loop are in same direction.
