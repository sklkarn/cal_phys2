  <title>Musical Instruments</title>
  
<introduction>
  <p>
     A tool used to produce a musical sound is known as musical instrument, e.g., 
     guitar, violin, flute, vocal cord, etc. The property of sound can be defined by 
     its pitch, loudness, periodicity, and quality. Some terminologies of physics 
     used to describe the property of sound in musical instruments are being discussed here. 
     The property of an oscillating system in which system prefers to vibrate in certain special 
     ways are called <term>normal modes</term> or natural frequency. It is a pattern of 
     vibrational motion in which all parts of the system oscillates sinusoidally with the 
     same frequency with constant phase relation between different parts of the system. 
     Any possible vibrational pattern of a system can be decomposed into a linear combination of 
     these normal modes.  The simplest normal mode of vibration in which system can oscillate is known 
     as <term>fundamental mode</term> or fundamental frequency. It is the lowest frequency produced by an instrument. 
  </p>
  <p>
   <term> Pitch, Notes and Tones:</term> A pitch is the frequency of a sound that can be heard by a 
   listener. The frequency of vibration of the vocal chord is perceived as the pitch of the voice. 
   A note is a mixture of several frequencies of sound. It is pleasant to hear. A tone is a steady 
   periodic sound characterized by timber or quality of a frequency. It is a single frequency sound.  
   In physics pitch, notes, and tones all describe the frequency of vibration. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Noise:</term> A note (sound) which is unpleasant to hear is called a noise. 
    In case of music notes which are pleasant to one listener may be noise to another. 
    Hence noise and melody also depend upon the mental status of listeners.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Harmonics:</term>  An instrument that produces the standing wave pattern at specific 
    frequencies (equal to its natural frequencies of vibration) is known as harmonics<idx><h>harmonics</h></idx>. 
    Other than a harmonic frequency, the resulting disturbance of the medium is irregular and 
    non-periodic. Harmonics are an integral multiple of fundamental frequency. 
    Harmonics can be expressed as 
    <me>
      f_{n} = nf_{o},\quad \text{where}\quad n=1,2,3, \cdots.
    </me>
    The fundamental frequency of vibration is also called a first harmonics. 
    <me>
      \text{I harmonics}, \quad f_{1} = f_{o}, \quad  \text{fundamental frequency}; 
    </me>
    <me>
      \text{II harmonics},\quad f_{2} = 2f_{o}; 
    </me>
    <me>
      \quad \text{III harmonics}, f_{2} = 3f_{o},
    </me>
      and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Overtones:</term> A frequency higher than fundamental frequency (or higher than first harmonics) 
    is known as overtones<idx>overtones</idx>. If the multiple of fundamental frequency is not integral 
    than the overtones is non-harmonic overtones. II harmonics is called a first overtones, 
    III harmonics is called a II overtones, and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Resonance:</term> 
    The condition at which vibrating frequency of an oscillating system matched with a natural 
    frequency of that system so that the frequency of vibration becomes maximum is known as 
    resonance<idx><h>resonance</h></idx>. Resonance is a frequency at which standing waves 
    are produced. The natural frequencies of a musical instrument are reffered as the harmonics of the instrument.

  <title>Stretched String</title>
  <p>
   The string on a musical instrument is fixed at both ends, so any vibration of the string 
   must have nodes at each end. Guitar, Violin, etc are string instruments. Consider a string 
   of length, L is stretched on both ends and plugged at middle in such a way that it produces 
   standing waves of fundamental frequency as shown in <xref ref="strstring"/>.

  <title>Organ Pipe</title>
  <p>
   It is a musical instrument which produces standing waves if the vibration is set up at 
   one end of the pipe. Vibration set up at one end get reflected back from the other end 
   and once they overlap standing wave pattern produced with a melodious sound. 
   There are two types of organ pipe.

         It is observed that in case of closed pipe frequency of higher modes of vibration is 
         odd multiples of fundamental frequency. Even harmonics are missing in this case hence 
         sound quality is poor.
