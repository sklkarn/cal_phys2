  <title>Magnetic Field</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      <term>Magnetic Field:</term>  It is a region of space around a magnet or moving charges 
      where magnetic effects can be experienced. [<em>The changing electric field can also creates 
      magnetic field and vise a versa.</em>] It is a vector quantity. Its magnitude depends upon 
      the density of magnetic field lines and direction depends upon the direction of magnetic 
      line at that particular point. The CGS unit of magnetic field is <m>Gauss</m> and SI unit is <m>Tesla</m> (T). 
      <me>
        1 \,Gauss = 1\times10^{-4}\,Tesla;
      </me>
     the other unit of magnetic field <m>\vec{B}</m> is (<m>Tesla = T = W_{b}/m^{2} = N/A.m</m>)
       </p>

       <p> Magnetic field lines are an imaginary path along which a unit north pole could move 
        freely if it is alowed to do so. Magnetic lines are always pointed away from north 
        pole and towards a south pole of a magnet as shown in <xref ref="barmagfield"/>. 
        The properties of magnetic field lines can be summarized as:
      <ol>
        <li>
          The direction of magnetic field is tangent to the field line at any point in space. 
      A small compass needle will point in the direction of the field line.
        </li>
        <li>
          The strength of the field is proportional to the density of the lines. 
          It is exactly proportional to the number of lines per unit area perpendicular 
          to the lines. Hence the field is stronger near the poles and weeker at far points.
        </li>
        <li>
          Magnetic field lines can never cross each other, i.e., the field has a unique 
          direction at any point in space. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Magnetic field lines are continuous, forming closed loops without beginning or end. 
          They go from the north pole to the south pole to the north pole again.
        </li>
      </ol>
      The north and south poles of a magnet can never be separated. It is a distinct difference 
      from electric field lines, which begin on the positive and end on negative charges. 
      </p>

    <term>Magnetic Dipole:</term> When two equal but opposite magnetic poles are separated by a small distance it is called 
   a magnetic dipole. Since magnetic monopoles do not exist it can better be defined in the 
   form of a current loop. The orbiting or spinning electron forms a current loop which generates 
   a magnetic field called a magnetic dipole and its strength is called a magnetic dipole moment, 
   <m>\mu= IA,</m> where I is a current and A is area of the loop as shown in <xref ref="dipolemnt"/>. 
   It is a vector quantity which is used to measure the tendency of an object to interact with 
   an external magnetic field. The direction of dipole moment is described by right hand thumb rule. 
   If four fingers of right hand are curled up in a direction of current then thumb pointed in 
   the direction of dipole moment. When there are unpaired electrons in an orbital of an atom 
   their spin moments do not cancel out and give rise to overall magnetic moment of the material. 
   As the single electrons are added the spin moments are combined and the resultant spin moments 
   of the atom increases and become maximum when the outer shell is half filled. Spin moments 
   decreases as further electrons are added to the outer-shell until it is completely filled. 
   The magnetic field around a current loop is shown in <xref ref="dipolemntb"/>. 
   The direction and magnitude of field (lines) depend upon the position of point of consideration 
   from the center of the current loop. Field is perpendicular to the plane of loop at its center. 
   </p>
   <p>
    <term>Magnetic Poles:</term> In a current loop, if arrows draw on the legs of letter <term>N</term> follow the direction of current 
    then this plane surface of the loop behaves as a <em>North Pole</em> 
     and if it follows arrows on letter <term>S</term> then it behaves like a <em>South Pole</em> 
     as ashown in <xref ref="magpole"/> and <xref ref="magpoleb"/>.

    Most of the forces a magnet exerts comes from its ends. Hence magnet possesses 
    two poles at its two ends. If a magnet is pivoted at its center in such a way that 
    it can swing freely, then it always comes to at rest by pointing one of its ends 
    towards north and the other towards south direction. The north-pointing end is called a 
    <em>North-Seeking</em> or <term>N pole</term> and the south-pointing end is called 
    <term>S Pole</term> or <em>South-Seeking</em>. Like poles repel and unlike poles attract. 
    North and south poles always exist in pairs (there are no magnetic monopoles in nature), 
    so if one were to split a permanent magnet in half, two smaller magnets would be created, 
    each with a north pole and south pole. Even if one cut a magnet into pieces all the way down 
    to a single atom they still get a N pole and a S pole because of orbiting electron as 
    shown in <xref ref="barmagnet"/>. There is no such thing as a single free magnetic pole. 
   </p>
   <p>
    A bar magnet can be considered as composed of many tiny current loops. 
    The currents on the loop around the periphery of a bar magnet at each cross-sectional 
    plane survive producing a resultant current around the outer surface whereas inner currents 
    cancel out one another  within the cross-sectional plane. Hence the cause of any magnet 
    is intrinsic current loop around the outer surface of a magnet. Since many atoms of 
    a bar magnet alligned in a same direction when exposed the magentic material into an 
    external field there always exists a N-pole and a S-pole as shown in <xref ref="barmagloop"/>.

  <p>
    The orbital and spin motion of electrons or the interaction of one electron to the other 
    is the origin of magnetism of any materials. Hence all most all materials display magnetic behaviors. 
    On the basis of magnetic behaviors there are three types of materials. They are 
    <ol marker="i.">
      <li>
        Ferromagnetic,
      </li>
      <li>
        Paramagnetic, and
      </li>
      <li>
        Diamagnetic.
      </li>
    </ol>
    However, there are three other types of magnetic behaviors also found in nature they 
    are ferrimagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and superparamagnetic which are not the part of discussion here.

    It has a very strong magnetization. <term>Magnetization</term> is a physical process of being 
    magnetized when a material is subjected to an external magnetic field. The atomic dipole 
    moments are very strong in these type of materials. Most permanent magnets are ferromagnetic 
    materials such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium. Transition metals and some rare earth 
    metals exhibits ferromagnetic behavior. Unpaired electrons spins in partially filled 
    orbitals gives rise to a local magnetic moment. Actually, unpaired electrons containing 
    atoms are very close to each other (and hence there is strong exchange interactions between them) 
    which creates domains in the crystal structure that have the same direction supporting each other. 
    In ferromagnetic materials magnetic dipoles are aligned in a specific direction in a small 
    group within the materials called a <em>domain</em>. The direction of dipole moments vary 
    from one domain to another which cancels the effect of one another and material does not 
    show any intrinsic specific magnetic behavior. But as the material is exposed to an external 
    magnetic field dipole moments of all domains aligned in the direction of external magnetic 
    field and material behaves like a magnet. Once the dipoles aligned in one direction 
    they retain in the same direction even after removal of external field. Hence the permanent 
    magnets are made out of ferromagnetic materials. Bar magnet, horse shoe magnet, disc magnet, <xref ref="magnets"/>. 
    are some examples of permanent magnets. <xref ref="elemag"/> is an electromagnet whose core 
    is often made from ferromagnetic material. 
  </p>
 </subsubsection>

 <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-para">
  <title>Paramagnetic Material:</title>
  <p>
    It has a week atomic dipole moment. Unpaired electrons in a partially filled orbitals 
    give rise to a net magnetic moment of atoms but due to thermal agitation the resultant 
    magnetic moment of the materials is zero and hence show no magnetic behavior on its own. 
    Aluminum, magnesium, tungsten, and titanium are some examples of paramagnetic materials. 
    Unpaired electrons in a paramagnetic material are relatively far away from each other 
    hence the exchange interaction is very weak and can not creates any domain. The magnetic 
    moments of such atoms are oriented in random direction and they cancel out each other effect. 
    When subjected to an external magnetic field magnetic moment of the material however, 
    align in a direction to the external filed and starts showing net magnetization. 
    Again, magnetization becomes zero with the removal of external field.
  </p>
 </subsubsection>

 <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-dia">
  <title>Diamagnetic Material:</title>
  <p>
    This type of materials are composed of atoms that do not possess any net magnetic moments i.e., 
    all the orbitals of atoms are filled and there are no unpaired electrons. Bismuth, copper, 
    lead, mercury, silver, gold, tin, diamond, water, and graphite are some examples of diamagnetic 
    materials. However, when subject to an external field dipole moments induced in a material 
    opposite to external field. Hence diamagnetic materials are deflected away from the magnetic field. 
    The magnetization of such materials becomes zero after removal of external fields.

   Geomagnetism is the study of the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field, which is produced 
   in the inner core. The Earth's magnetic field is predominantly a geo-axial dipole, with 
   north and south magnetic poles located near the <m>10^{o}</m> from the geographic poles 
   that undergo periodic reversals and excursions. The Earth's magnetic field is attributed 
   to a dynamo effect of circulating electric current, but it is not constant in direction. 
   Rock specimens of different ages in similar locations have different directions of permanent 
   magnetization. The circulating electric currents in the Earth's molten metallic core are 
   the cause of the earth's magnetic field. Convection drives the outer-core fluid and it 
   circulates relative to the earth. This means the electrically conducting material moves 
   relative to the earth's magnetic field. If it can obtain a charge by some interaction 
   like friction between layers, an effective current loop could be produced. The magnetic 
   field of a current loop could sustain the magnetic dipole type field of the earth 
   [<xref ref="earthmagfield"/>]. The  magnitude of magnetic field at the surface of the 
   Earth is about <em>half a Gauss</em> and dips toward the Earth in the northern hemisphere. 
   The magnitude varies over the surface of the Earth in the range 0.3  to 0.6 Gauss.

        <term>Magnetic Meridian: </term> 
        An imaginary vertical plane passing through the axis of a freely suspended magnet 
        is called a magnetic meridian. The direction of Earth's magnetic field lies in the 
        magnetic meridian may or may not be horizontal. The vertical plane passing through 
        the  geographical axis of Earth is called geographical meridian [<xref ref="diclination"/>]. 
        The angle between the magnetic meridian and the geographic meridian at a place is 
        called a <term>magnetic declination, D</term> at that place. At equator it is zero 
        since field is parallel to the earth surface and is maximum at poles. The declination 
        is expressed in degrees East <m>(^{o} E)</m> or degrees West <m>(^{o} W).</m> 
        For example a declination of <m>2^{o} E</m> means the compass will point 2 degrees 
        east of true geographical North. Thus, the knowledge of declination at a place 
        helps in finding the true geographical directions at that place. The declination at 
        point O is <m>D^{o}E.</m>
      </li>
      <li>
        <term>Magnetic Inclination</term> or <em>magnetic dip</em> is the angle (I) 
        between the horizontal component of earth's magnetic field (H) and the total magnetic 
        field vector <m>\vec{B}.</m> Moving closer to magnetic poles results in one side of the 
        compass needle pointing downwards. Between the magnetic poles there is an area called 
        the magnetic equator where inclination or the magnetic dip angle is zero; the magnetic 
        field vector does not have a vertical component <m>(V)</m> in this area. To the north of 
        the magnetic equator, the north end of the compass needle points downward, both I and H are positive. 
        To the south of the magnetic equator, the south end of the needle points downward, 
        that is I and H are both negative.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-mag_force">
  <title>Magnetic Force on a Moving Charge</title>
  <p>
    If a charge <m>q</m> is moving with a velocity <m>v</m> in a magnetic field <m>B</m>, 
    then at any point of its path it experiences a magnetic force <m>F</m>, given by
    <men xml:id="eqn-magf1">
      \vec{F} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = qvB\sin\theta \quad (Vector)
    </men>
    <me>
      \text{or,}\quad F  = |q| v B_{\perp} \quad (Magnitude),
    </me>
    where <m>\theta</m> is an angle between <m>v</m> and <m>B</m>. The direction of force <m>F</m> 
    is always perpendicular to the plane describes by <m>v</m> and <m>B</m>. If <m>\theta=90^{o}</m> 
    the force is maximum, if <m>\theta=0^{o}</m> or <m>v = 0</m> then no force acting on a charge. 
    The direction of force can be determined by <term>Fleming's Left hand rule</term>, 
    by stretching thumb, forefinger, and middle finger of the left hand perpendicular to each other, 
    where <em>forefinger</em> pointed in a direction of magnetic field, <em>middle finger</em> 
    pointed in a direction of motion of charge then <em>thumb</em> must shows the direction of 
    force experienced by a charge as shown in <xref ref="FLHrule"/>.

   <p>
  Since moving charge experiences magnetic force perpendicular to its motion, 
  magnetic force does no work on moving charge. Hence magnetic field only changes the direction 
  of velocity of the charged particle but not the magnitude of its velocity. A particle moving in 
  a constant force perpendicular to its motion leads to the circular motion.
