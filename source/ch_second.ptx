  <introduction>
    <p>
      It is a branch of physics which deals with the motion of charges in a conductor. 
      [<em>The study of motion of electric charges in vacuum or semiconducting materials is known in electronics.</em>]
     </p>

     <p>
      <term>Current, <m>I</m>:</term> An electric current is defined as the transfer of charge through 
      any area of cross-section per unit time. If a net charge <m>q</m> passes through any cross-sectional 
      area of a conductor in time <m>t,</m> then electric current is given by 
      <men xml:id="eqn-current1">
        I=\frac{q}{t}.
      </men>
       It's unit is Ampere, i.e. one ampere of current represents one coulomb of charge passes through 
       a conductor in one second. It is a scalar quantity but it's conventional direction of motion 
       is taken as the direction of flow of positive charges. In a conductor current flows solely 
       due to the motion of electrons, hence the direction of current is opposite to electron-flow. 
       From the law of conservation of charges current remains constant in a conductor irrespective of 
       the local area of cross-section. When the direction of motion of charge does not change with time, 
       the current is said to be a <term>direct current, or DC</term>, but when the direction of charge 
       motion reverses periodically, the current is known as <term>alternating current, or AC</term>.
     </p>
     <p>
      If <m>\,dq </m> amount of charges passes through any cross section, <m>s</m> of a conductor in time <m>\,dt</m> 
      then electric current <m>\,dI</m> through that conductor is given by  
      <me>
        I=\frac{\,dq}{\,dt}
      </me>
       and current <m>\,dI</m> passes through an infinitesimal area  <m>\,dA</m> normally is 
       called a <term>current density, <m>J</m></term>, 
       <men xml:id="eqn-current2">
        J=\frac{\,dI}{\,dA} 
       </men>
       <me>
        \text{or,}\quad \,dI=J.\,dA
       </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The total current density through a given cross-section <m>A</m> of a conductor is then writen as 
          <me>
           I = \int\limits_{s} J.\,dA
          </me>
        Hence current can also be defined as the flux of current density over a given area [<xref ref="curdensity"/>]. 
        It is vector quantity. It's direction is along the direction of flow of current and 
        it's unit is  <m>\frac{Ampere}{meter^2}</m> or <m>(A/m^2)</m>.

    <term>Drift Velocity, <m>v_d</m>:</term> In a metallic conductor electrons are moving randomly 
    in a pool of positive and negative charges in all possible directions which constitute no net current. 
    When an electric field is applied across a conductor these electrons (or charge carriers) begin to 
    flow in one particular direction giving rise to current in a conductor. During the motion 
    these electrons interact with residual positively charged atoms and other electrons which 
    change their motion in a zig-zag path resulting a longer time to reach at the other end of 
    the conductor. The  average velocity with which these electrons can move inside the conductor 
    in presence of electric field is called a <em>drift velocity</em>. We will know latter that 
    the drift velocity does not depend on length or area of cross-section of a conductor.
