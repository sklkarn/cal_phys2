  <title>Geometrical Optics</title>
  

  <introduction>
     <p>
      Geometric optics is based on the principle of rectilinear propagation of light in which 
      light is considered as a ray which travels in a straight line. Anything which radiates 
      or emits light is known as object. Objects that emit light on their own are called luminous 
      (or <em>self-luminous</em>) objects such as sun, stars, light bulb etc. Objects that do not 
      emit or reflect light are known as <em>non-luminous</em> objects such as wood, plastics, metals etc. 
      Luminous object can either emits light or reflect light from another source such as moon, 
      mirror, etc. An object which has no physical extent is called a point object and an object 
      which has length, width, and height is known as <em>extended object</em>. An image on the other hand is 
      an apparent replica of an object. A line which is normal to the wavefronts of the actual light 
      along which energy flow is known as <term>ray of light</term>. A collection of rays of light is 
      known as <term>beam</term>. A collection of parallel rays of light is known as  <term>parallel beam</term>, 
      rays converging to a point is known as  <term>convergent beam</term>, and rays diverging from a 
      point is known as  <term>divergent beam</term>.

  <title>Reflection</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      When wave travels in a homogeneous medium strikes on the surface of another medium bouncing 
      back to the same medium is known as reflection. There are two types of reflection, 
      spectacular (regular) reflection and diffuse (irregular) reflection. Both types of 
      reflection obey the Laws of reflection. 
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-refl_laws">
    <title>Laws of Reflection</title>
    <p>
      The first law of reflection states that the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal 
      to the point of incident all lie in the same plane. The second law of reflection states that 
      the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.

      Consider a plane wave progressing towards a smooth surface, like glass or mirror as shown 
      in <xref ref="ref1"/>. A light ray, AO perpendicular to the wavefronts is making an angle 
      of incidence, i with the normal, N. The side, X of the progressing wavefront, XY has just 
      made contact with the surface of the mirror. While Y is moving the distance, vt, a secondary 
      wavelet emanates from X and also travels the distance, vt. At the end of the time interval, t, 
      Y will have just made contact with the surface, at the point Y'. The new reflected wavefront 
      is found from Huygens's principle by drawing the new wave front such that it touches 
      the point Y' and is tangent to the secondary wavelet from X. The point of tangency is called 
      X'. The new wavefront is shown in <xref ref="ref1"/> as the blue line X'Y'.  The wave is said 
      to have been reflected. The new reflected ray, OB is drawn perpendicular to the wavefront, X'Y'.  
      The rest of the reflected wavefronts are drawn parallel to X'Y' and perpendicular to ray, OB.  
      The reflected ray, OB makes an angle r is called the <em>angle of reflection</em>, with the 
      normal, N. Because the incident ray, AO is perpendicular to the wavefront, XY, the angle that 
      the wavefront, XY makes with the surface is the same as the angle of incidence, i. 
      This can be seen by looking at triangle, <m>\bigtriangleup XEO</m>. The sum of all the angles in triangle, XEO 
       must equal <m>180^{o}</m>, and consider <m>\angle EXO = \theta,</m> then 
       <me>
        \theta+\alpha+\angle XEO=180^{o}
       </me>
       <me>
        or,\quad \theta+\alpha+90^{o}=180^{o}
       </me>
       <me>
        or, \quad \theta+\alpha = 90^{o}
       </me>
       <me>
        But, \quad \angle AOX+\angle AOXN= 90^{o}
       </me>
       <me>
        or, \quad i+\alpha = 90^{o}
       </me>
     <me>
      \therefore \quad \theta = i 
     </me>
     Similarly, since reflected ray OB is perpendicular to reflected wavefront X'Y', 
     it makes an angle r with the reflecting surface. We see in the figure that in triangle XYY', 
     <me>
      \sin i = \frac{vt}{XY'} 
     </me>
     From <m>\bigtriangleup XX'Y'</m>, we have 
     <me>
      \sin r = \frac{vt}{XY'}
     </me>
     <me>
      i.e.\quad  \sin i = \sin r \qquad \Rightarrow  i =r
     </me>
     Which proves the second law of reflection and it says that the angle of incidence i is 
     equal to the angle of reflection r. The first law of reflection was implied in the derivation 
     and it says that the incident ray, the normal, and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane. 
     We have derived the law of reflection by Huygens's principle and the wave 
     nature of light. Having thus established the law, we can simplify the procedure for its use 
     by drawing the ray diagram as in <xref ref="ref3"/> where the faint blue plane is an imaginary
      plane which contains the incident ray, (OA), the normal, (ON), and the reflected ray, (OB).

  <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-reg_diff">
    <title>Regular and Diffuse Reflection</title>
    <p>
      Reflection from a smooth surface such as a mirror leads to a type of reflection known 
      as regular reflection. In regular reflection a parallel incident beam after reflection 
      deviates parallely onto another direction as shown <xref ref="ref"/>. Reflection from a 
      rough surface such as paper, wall, and clothes leads to a diffuse reflection. In diffuse 
      reflection rays of light in a parallel incident beam after reflection scattered in different 
      directions as shown in <xref ref="diffuse"/>. Whether it is a regular or a diffuse reflection 
      laws of reflection are always obeyed by each individual light ray of the beam at every point of 
      incidence. The normals at the point of incidences P, Q, and R in <xref ref="diffuse"/>
       are shown by the dotted lines. The normal on a rough surface depends on a inclination of 
       local surface at the point of incidence hence these normals are not parallel which 
       constitutes parallel beam of light to be scattered in different directions. 
       The orientation of the normal lines at neighboring points along a surface differentiates 
       specular from diffuse reflection. If the normal lines are parallel, reflection will be specular. 
       If they are not parallel, reflection will be diffuse.

    <p>
      It is the diffuse reflection which makes us see the world such as walls of the room, 
      clothes, trees, stars, clouds, etc. As the rays of light falls on any object, 
      the rays are reflected from the object and then enter into our eye. If the reflection 
      is only regular then the object would be dazzlingly bright. Aside from the limited number 
      of luminous objects, such as light bulbs and the sun, everything we see around us is 
      visible because of the diffuse reflection.

    <title>Image formed by a mirror</title>
    <p>
      <em>A plane reflecting surface is a special surface of spherical reflecting surface with infinite radius of curvature.</em>
      A mirror is a highly polished smooth surface which allows a regular reflection. 
      When these reflected rays fall in our eyes we see the image of that object. 
      Depends upon the shape of reflecting surface there are many types of mirror such as plane mirror, 
      spherical mirror, parabolic mirror, etc. There are also two types of existence of image (or object) 
      called a <em>real image or object</em> and a <em>virtual image or object</em>. 
      If incident rays are coming from an object lying in front of the mirror, object is 
      known as real. If incident rays appear to converge behind the mirror, the point of 
      convergence is known as virtual object. If reflected rays actually converge the image 
      formed is real. A real image is always formed in front of the mirror. If reflected rays 
      are divergent that is they do not meet actually, rather they appear to come from a point, 
      that point is called virtual image. A virtual image is always formed behind the mirror. 
      In real image light rays which constitute an image is really passing through it. 
      In virtual image the light rays which constitute that image do not actually pass through 
      it but only appear to do so. Real image can be cast on a screen but virtual image can not 
      be cast on a screen as it is formed behind the reflecting surface. Plane mirror never 
      form a real image of any real object.

   A plane mirror is a highly smoothed flat surface or a glass plate. One side of the  plate 
   is silver coated and is called a <em>silvered surface</em>, another side of it is highly smoothed 
   (fine polished) from which light beam undergoes a regular reflection to form an image and is 
   called a <em>reflecting surface</em> as shown in <xref ref="pimage"/>. In other words, 
   if a reflecting surface is  plane or if radius of curvature of the surface is infinite 
   then it behaves like a mirror, and is called a <term>plane mirror</term>. Any thing from which 
   light rays emanate and incident to the mirror is called an <term>object</term>. 
   The reflected rays from the mirror either actually converge to a point or appear to 
   diverge from a point. The point of intersection of reflected rays is called an <term>image</term>.

    <p>
      When an object, O is placed in front of a plane mirror, MN an image I is formed behind the mirror. 
      To determine how an image is formed, we need to consider at least two light rays that emanate 
      from the object, O. Consider the ray, OA which makes an angle of incidence, i with the normal to 
      the mirror. By the law of reflection, this ray is reflected along AB such that the angle of 
      reflection is r. When these reflected light rays enters into the observer's eye it appears 
      to have come from behind the mirror from point, I as indicated by the dashed line. The second 
      incident ray, OC is reflected along CD. To an observer in front of the mirror at D this reflected 
      ray also appears to come from the same point I behind the mirror, as indicated by the dashed line.  
      The two reflected  rays appear to have come from the point I  behind the mirror where the two 
      dashed lines intersect. The point I is called the image of the object O.  The distance from 
      the image to the mirror is called the image distance and is designated by the letter q. 
      The image is called a virtual image because the light rays do not actually come from that point,
      they only appear to come from that point. If you were to walk behind the mirror, you would not 
      find any real image there. A real image can be projected onto a screen while a virtual image cannot. 
      In general, a real image is one on which all the rays are converging, while a virtual image is 
      one from which all the rays are diverging. Thus, rays AB and CD are diverging away from the 
      virtual image I and will never cross on the left-hand side of the mirror. We should also note 
      that there is a third ray that can be used. This is the ray that is perpendicular to the mirror. 
      Since its angle of incidence is zero, its reflected angle is also zero, and the ray is reflected 
      back along the normal. This ray appears to come from directly behind the mirror and is also 
      indicated by a dashed line that comes from the image point I.
    </p>
    <p>
      An image formed by a plane mirror is virtual, object distance is equal to image distance, 
      and the size of image is the same as the size of object.

      From the geometry of the <xref ref="pimage"/> 
      <me>
        \angle NAB = \angle PIA =r \quad \text{corresponding angles are equal}

      <me>
        \angle POA = \angle OAN = i \quad \text{alternating angles are equal}

      Hence in <m>\bigtriangleup^{s} OPA</m> and <m>IPA</m>, we have

<me>
  \angle POA = \angle PIA \quad [\text{law of reflection}]
</me>
<me>
  \therefore \quad \bigtriangleup OPA \cong \bigtriangleup IPA 
</me>
In congruent triangles corresponding arms are equal  hence, object distance, OP is equal to 
image distance, IP. Since no light rays are really passing through the point I constituting a 
virtual image. To understand the size of the image formed by a plane mirror let us consider 
an extended object P as shown in <xref ref="linversion"/>. Because object distance is equal to 
image distance the rays from each point of an object reflected from the mirror in such 
a way that they appear to come from the side wise inverted image behind the mirror. 
Hence a letter p looks like q in image. The process of inversion of left side of an object 
as its right side of its mirror image is known as a <term>lateral inversion</term>. 
From the <xref ref="linversion"/> it is clearly seen that the each rays from the object p 
incident normally onto the mirror and get reflected also normally so that each rays 
are parallel to each other. Which verifies the size of the image is equal to the size of 
the object. When the plane mirror is rotated through an angle <m>\theta</m>, the reflected 
ray turns through <m>2\theta</m> keeping the incident ray constant, as shown in <xref ref="rotatedmir"/>.

      In <xref ref="rotatedmir"/>, <m>\angle POL = g,</m> is called glancing angle. 
      It is the angle made by the incident ray with the reflecting surface so that <m>g+i=90^{o}</m>. 
      Now <m>\angle MOQ =g=\angle POL</m>, vertically opposite angle and <m>\angle ROM = g.</m> 
      Since <m>i=r</m> and <m>r+g=90^{o},</m> i.e, <m>\angle ROQ = 2g</m>. Once the mirror, LM

      The point on the principle axis through which the reflected rays of all the incident rays

      of the mirror as shown in <xref ref="concavemir2"/> and <xref ref="convexmir2"/>. 
      The size of the mirror is called the <term>aperture</term> of the mirror. If the aperture 
      of a mirror is small then reflected rays of any beam parallel to the principle axis either 
      must pass through  or appear to diverge from the focus of the the mirror. In the case of 
      a mirror of large aperture these reflected rays fail to meet at a single focus point, 
      such inability of a mirror to focus all the reflected rays of a parallel incident beam 
      at a single point is called geometrical or <em>spherical aberration</em> of the mirror. 
      The light rays that lie close to the principal axis are called <em>paraxial rays</em> 
      and they only able to meet at a single focus after reflection from the mirror. 
      The rays that lie far from the principal axis are called <em>marginal rays</em> 
      and after reflection  they cross the principle axis before focus point. Hence, the 
      reflection of large beam of light from the spherical mirror of large aperture creates 
      a curved shape of light called a <term>caustic curve</term> as shown in <xref ref="caustic"/>. 
      The cusp of caustic curves lie at the focus of the mirror. Spherical aberration can be 
      minimized by using a mirror of small aperture which is smaller compared to its radius of 
      curvature. Parabolic mirror will also minimize such spherical aberration.

  <title>Refraction</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The phenomenon of bending of light ray as it goes from one medium to another is called 
      a refraction. The velocity of light depends on the medium it is propagating which causes 
      the refraction. The measure of an obstacle that a medium imposes on the velocity of light 
      is known as <term>refractive index</term> of that medium. Hence the light ray bend as it 
      goes from a medium of lower refractive index to the higher one or vice a versa.  
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="refr">
        <caption></caption>
        <image source="refr.png" width="45%"/>
    </figure>
      <p>
        If c is a velocity of light in a vacuum and v is the velocity of light in a given 
        medium then the refractive index of this medium is defined as 
        <men xml:id="eqn-refract1">
          \eta =  \frac{c}{v}
        </men>
         Medium with higher refractive index is known as optically <term>denser medium </term> and 
         that with lower refractive index is known as optically <term>rare medium</term>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <alert>Note:</alert> Optically denser and rare has nothing to do with the density of the 
            medium which is sometimes misunderstood. However, refractive index of a medium is 
            proportional to the density of that medium. As the temperature increases the density 
            of the medium decreases generally and so is its refractive index. For example, water 
            has density of <m>1\,g/ml</m> and  refractive index of <m>1.3235</m>  
            whereas isopropyle alcohol has density of <m>0.785\,g/ml</m> and  refractive index of 
            <m>1.3772</m> it means light bend more in alcohol then in water. The refractive index 
            of vacuum is 1 and that for air is 1.0003 hence they are taken as same.  When a ray is 
            incident on the surface separating two media it either bends towards or away from the 
            normal at the point of incidence. If light goes from rare to denser it bends towards 
            the normal and if it goes from denser to rare it bends away from the normal. The angle 
            between initial direction of light to the final direction in the second medium is known 
            as angle of deviation, <m>\delta</m>.

            Consider a plane wavefront APB is coming to incident on plane MN. By the time the disturbance 
            at B reaches to C, the secondary waves from A must have traveled a distance <m>AD=v_{b}t</m> 
            where t is the time taken by the waves to travel the distance BC.

               As velocity of light is less in medium b, the refracted wavefront is given by the 
               tangent CD drawn at point D, where AD is a radius of sphere centered at point A. 
               The line CD happens to be an envelop of all the secondary wavelets of wavefront APB

  <title>Total Internal Reflection</title>
 <introduction>
 
  <p>
    When a ray of light passes from an optically denser medium to the rare medium it bends 
    away from the normal. If the angle of incidence in this case is increased gradually 
    then at particular angle of incidence the refracted ray starts grazing on the surface 
    separating two media i.e., angle of refraction becomes <m>90^{o}</m>. The angle of 
    incidence at that condition is called a <term>critical angle, c</term>. If the angle 
    of incidence is further increased above the critical angle then the light ray returns 
    into the same denser medium, such phenomenon is called the <term>total internal reflection</term>. 
    Since the reflection happen at a very top thin surface of interface and it is assumed 
    that there is no loss of energy in the form of transmission or absorption, hence the 
    name total internal reflection.  Starting from angle of incidence <m>i=0,</m> angle of 
    refraction <m>r=0</m> as i increases r also increases if the ray of light is going from 
    denser to a rare medium as shown in <xref ref="tir"/>. When  <m>i=c,</m> (the critical angle) 
    then the angle of refraction,  <m>r=90^{o}</m>. Hence from Snell's law

    \text{or,}\quad\eta_{b}\sin c = \eta_{a}\sin 90

  <me>
    or, \quad \sin c = \frac{\eta_{a}}{\eta_{b}}=\frac{1}{\eta_{b}} 
  </me>

  Now once the <m>i \gt c</m> the refracted ray disappears and appears as a 
  reflected ray in the same medium, b and obeys all the laws of reflection.
</p>
<p>
  This phenomenon is very useful in sending the light signal through an optical fiber, 
and changing the direction of ray of light using prism.  Rainbow, mirage, and sparkling 
of diamond can be possible due to total internal reflection.

<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-mirage">
  <title>Mirage</title>
  <p>
    It is an optical illusion which gives the deceptive appearance of image of a distant 
    object as it is formed in a pool of water. <em>Mirage</em> is caused by refraction of the light 
    rays in layers of air of varying density. In a hot summer day in a desert or on a highway 
    layers of varying density of air is formed because of heat. Layer of air near the surface 
    of earth is hotter than it is above the surface of earth.

  <p>
Colder air above the earth behaves as a denser medium and hotter air near the earth 
surface behaves as rare medium. Now when a light ray coming from a tall distant object
passes through a denser to a rare medium keep bending away from normal and when angle 
of incidence becomes greater than the critical angle it gets total internal reflection. 
When this ray falls on the observer's eye it appears to come from an inverted image of 
that tall object which deceives the observer's that there may be a puddle of water near 
the tall object as shown in <xref ref="mirage"/>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, in a cold winter days near the sea-shore an  inverted or upright 
    image of an object such as a boat can be seen hanging in the sky. This is all because 
    of the bending of light. When the virtual image of an object over a body of water, 
    due to a cool, dense layers of air is seen then it is called a <em>looming</em> as 
    shown in <xref ref="looming"/>. Thus, an object like a boat below the horizon which 
    is not visible directly, will be seen apparently lifted into the sky.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a strong inversion layer extends upwards from the surface of a body of water an 
    enhanced bending of light happen and an object appears to be suspended in the air. 
    On the other hand, when the bottom of the inversion layer is some distance above the 
    water and the observer is slightly below the inversion layer as shown in <xref ref="mirage2"/>, 
    the observer sees the object hanging inverted in the sky called <em>superior mirage</em>.

    Consider a ray OP is incident on the refracting face, AB of the prism of refracting angle A. 
    After refraction through the prism the ray emerges along QR and gets deviated by an angle 
    <m>\delta</m> from its original direction. If a prism ABC is rotated about a point P in 
    such a way that angle of incidence increases gradually,then the angle of deviation, <m>\delta</m> 
    start decreasing initially obtains the minimum value and then start increasing again. 
    The condition at which angle of deviation becomes minimum is called the angle of minimum 
    deviation, <m>\delta_{min}</m> and it is a very special case in prism. At <m>\delta_{min}</m> 
    the refracted ray inside the prism is parallel to the base of the prism, and hence angle 
    of incidence, i = angle of emergence, e. This condition is useful to determine the 
    refractive index of the material of the prism.

  <title>Thin Lenses</title>
 <introduction>
  <p>
    A lens is a part of solid spherical refracting surfaces. If its thickness is very thin it is called a thin lens. 
    It is mainly of two types, concave lens and convex lens. The property of lens depends upon its shape and the 
    type of material it is made up off. The lens which consists of two inward curved surfaces is known as 
    <term>concave lens</term> and that which consists of two outward bulged surfaces is known as <term>convex lens</term>. 
    However the combination of types of surfaces gives a lens different shapes. 
    In <xref ref="lens"/> are biconvex lens, plano-convex lens, concavo-convex lens, biconcave lens, 
    plano-concavelens, and convexo-concave lens, respectively. Convex lenses are thicker at the middle 
    and thinner at the edges and concave lenses are thinner at the middle and thicker at the edges.

    Anatomy of lenses are shown in <xref ref="lanatomy"/>.  An imaginary line that bisects the 
    symmetrical lens into two halves is known as <em>vertical axis</em>. The center of sphere of 
    which a surface of lens is a part is known as <em>center of curvature</em>. There are two 
    faces in a lens so it has two centers of curvature, <m>C_{1},\quad C_{2}</m>. An imaginary 
    straight line that is passing through the geometrical centre of a lens and joining the two 
    centres of curvature of its surfaces is known as <em>optical axis</em>  or principle axis.  
    The light ray passing along this axis is perpendicular to the surfaces and will not deviate. 
    All other rays passing through a lens and its optical center are called secondary axes. 
    The geometric center of a lens is called an <em>optical center</em> of lens. The light ray 
    passing through the optical center will never deviate.

  The beam of light incident parallel 
  to the principal axis will converge when passing through a convex lens, and diverge when 
  passing through a concave lens. Since the convex lens converges the incident light rays it 
  is also known as <em>converging lens</em> and the concave lens diverges the incident light 
  rays it is also known as <em>diverging lens</em> (<xref ref="convergelens"/> and <xref ref="divergelens"/>). 
  In a lens it is convenient to take 2F points on the principle axis on both sides of the lens 
  to draw ray diagram. It is just double the focal length of the lens but not the  center of curvature.

    The point on the principle axis where the incident light rays parallel to the principle axis 
    after refraction from the lens will converge on or appear to diverge from  is known as <em>focus</em> 
    or focal point of a lens. Two foci exist in a lens, equidistant on either side of the lens, 
    since light behaves the same way when traveling in either direction (Principle of Reversibility). 
    The two foci, <m>F_{1}</m> and <m>F_{2}</m> are called the primary principal focus and the 
    secondary principal focus, respectively. An imaginary plane that is perpendicular to the 
    principal axis at the focal point is known as <em>focal plane</em>. The size of a lens is known 
    as <em>aperture</em>. The distance between the optical center, O to the center of curvature 
    is known as <em>radius of curvature, R</em> and the distance between optical center, O to 
    the focal point of a lens is known as <em>focal length, f </em>. The focal length, f is taken 
    as positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. The radius of curvature, R 
    is positive for convex surface and negative for concave surface. The shape of surface can be 
    defined from which surface is the light incident.

    A lens can be thought of as made up of a number of truncated prisms of varying refracting 
    angle pile on top of each other on both sides.  The refracting angle of a prism at the middle 
    portion is infinite hence it behaves like a simple glass slab. The refracting angles of the 
    prisms above or below the middle section of the lens gradually increase positively for convex 
    lens and negatively for concave lens as shown in <xref ref="lensprism1"/> and <xref ref="lensprism2"/>. 
    Since the prism bends the ray of light towards its base light converges in convex lens and diverges in concave 
    lens after passing through the lens.

      When object lies at 2f distance from equiconvex lens then its real image is formed at
