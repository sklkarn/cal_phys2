  <title>Geometrical Optics</title>
  

  <introduction>
     <p>
      Geometric optics is based on the principle of rectilinear propagation of light in which 
      light is considered as a ray which travels in a straight line. Anything which radiates 
      or emits light is known as object. Objects that emit light on their own are called luminous 
      (or <em>self-luminous</em>) objects such as sun, stars, light bulb etc. Objects that do not 
      emit or reflect light are known as <em>non-luminous</em> objects such as wood, plastics, metals etc. 
      Luminous object can either emits light or reflect light from another source such as moon, 
      mirror, etc. An object which has no physical extent is called a point object and an object 
      which has length, width, and height is known as <em>extended object</em>. An image on the other hand is 
      an apparent replica of an object. A line which is normal to the wavefronts of the actual light 
      along which energy flow is known as <term>ray of light</term>. A collection of rays of light is 
      known as <term>beam</term>. A collection of parallel rays of light is known as  <term>parallel beam</term>, 
      rays converging to a point is known as  <term>convergent beam</term>, and rays diverging from a 
      point is known as  <term>divergent beam</term>.

  <title>Reflection</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      When wave travels in a homogeneous medium strikes on the surface of another medium bouncing 
      back to the same medium is known as reflection. There are two types of reflection, 
      spectacular (regular) reflection and diffuse (irregular) reflection. Both types of 
      reflection obey the Laws of reflection. 
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-refl_laws">
    <title>Laws of Reflection</title>
    <p>
      The first law of reflection states that the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal 
      to the point of incident all lie in the same plane. The second law of reflection states that 
      the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.

      Consider a plane wave progressing towards a smooth surface, like glass or mirror as shown 
      in <xref ref="ref1"/>. A light ray, AO perpendicular to the wavefronts is making an angle 
      of incidence, i with the normal, N. The side, X of the progressing wavefront, XY has just 
      made contact with the surface of the mirror. While Y is moving the distance, vt, a secondary 
      wavelet emanates from X and also travels the distance, vt. At the end of the time interval, t, 
      Y will have just made contact with the surface, at the point Y'. The new reflected wavefront 
      is found from Huygens's principle by drawing the new wave front such that it touches 
      the point Y' and is tangent to the secondary wavelet from X. The point of tangency is called 
      X'. The new wavefront is shown in <xref ref="ref1"/> as the blue line X'Y'.  The wave is said 
      to have been reflected. The new reflected ray, OB is drawn perpendicular to the wavefront, X'Y'.  
      The rest of the reflected wavefronts are drawn parallel to X'Y' and perpendicular to ray, OB.  
      The reflected ray, OB makes an angle r is called the <em>angle of reflection</em>, with the 
      normal, N. Because the incident ray, AO is perpendicular to the wavefront, XY, the angle that 
      the wavefront, XY makes with the surface is the same as the angle of incidence, i. 
      This can be seen by looking at triangle, <m>\bigtriangleup XEO</m>. The sum of all the angles in triangle, XEO 
       must equal <m>180^{o}</m>, and consider <m>\angle EXO = \theta,</m> then 
       <me>
        \theta+\alpha+\angle XEO=180^{o}
       </me>
       <me>
        or,\quad \theta+\alpha+90^{o}=180^{o}
       </me>
       <me>
        or, \quad \theta+\alpha = 90^{o}
       </me>
       <me>
        But, \quad \angle AOX+\angle AOXN= 90^{o}
       </me>
       <me>
        or, \quad i+\alpha = 90^{o}
       </me>
     <me>
      \therefore \quad \theta = i 
     </me>
     Similarly, since reflected ray OB is perpendicular to reflected wavefront X'Y', 
     it makes an angle r with the reflecting surface. We see in the figure that in triangle XYY', 
     <me>
      \sin i = \frac{vt}{XY'} 
     </me>
     From <m>\bigtriangleup XX'Y'</m>, we have 
     <me>
      \sin r = \frac{vt}{XY'}
     </me>
     <me>
      i.e.\quad  \sin i = \sin r \qquad \Rightarrow  i =r
     </me>
     Which proves the second law of reflection and it says that the angle of incidence i is 
     equal to the angle of reflection r. The first law of reflection was implied in the derivation 
     and it says that the incident ray, the normal, and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane. 
     We have derived the law of reflection by Huygens's principle and the wave 
     nature of light. Having thus established the law, we can simplify the procedure for its use 
     by drawing the ray diagram as in <xref ref="ref3"/> where the faint blue plane is an imaginary
      plane which contains the incident ray, (OA), the normal, (ON), and the reflected ray, (OB).

  <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-reg_diff">
    <title>Regular and Diffuse Reflection</title>
    <p>
      Reflection from a smooth surface such as a mirror leads to a type of reflection known 
      as regular reflection. In regular reflection a parallel incident beam after reflection 
      deviates parallely onto another direction as shown <xref ref="ref"/>. Reflection from a 
      rough surface such as paper, wall, and clothes leads to a diffuse reflection. In diffuse 
      reflection rays of light in a parallel incident beam after reflection scattered in different 
      directions as shown in <xref ref="diffuse"/>. Whether it is a regular or a diffuse reflection 
      laws of reflection are always obeyed by each individual light ray of the beam at every point of 
      incidence. The normals at the point of incidences P, Q, and R in <xref ref="diffuse"/>
       are shown by the dotted lines. The normal on a rough surface depends on a inclination of 
       local surface at the point of incidence hence these normals are not parallel which 
       constitutes parallel beam of light to be scattered in different directions. 
       The orientation of the normal lines at neighboring points along a surface differentiates 
       specular from diffuse reflection. If the normal lines are parallel, reflection will be specular. 
       If they are not parallel, reflection will be diffuse.

      It is the diffuse reflection which makes us see the world such as walls of the room, 
      clothes, trees, stars, clouds, etc. As the rays of light falls on any object, 
      the rays are reflected from the object and then enter into our eye. If the reflection 
      is only regular then the object would be dazzlingly bright. Aside from the limited number 
      of luminous objects, such as light bulbs and the sun, everything we see around us is 
      visible because of the diffuse reflection.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-image_pmirror">
    <title>Image formed by a mirror</title>
    <p>
      A mirror is a highly polished smooth surface which allows a regular reflection. 
      When these reflected rays fall in our eyes we see the image of that object. 
      Depends upon the shape of reflecting surface there are many types of mirror such as plane mirror, 
      spherical mirror, parabolic mirror, etc. There are also two types of existence of image (or object) 
      called a <em>real image or object</em> and a <em>virtual image or object</em>. 
      If incident rays are coming from an object lying in front of the mirror, object is 
      known as real. If incident rays appear to converge behind the mirror, the point of 
      convergence is known as virtual object. If reflected rays actually converge the image 
      formed is real. A real image is always formed in front of the mirror. If reflected rays 
      are divergent that is they do not meet actually, rather they appear to come from a point, 
      that point is called virtual image. A virtual image is always formed behind the mirror. 
      In real image light rays which constitute an image is really passing through it. 
      In virtual image the light rays which constitute that image do not actually pass through 
      it but only appear to do so. Real image can be cast on a screen but virtual image can not 
      be cast on a screen as it is formed behind the reflecting surface. Plane mirror never 
      form a real image of any real object.

  <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-plan_mirror">
    <title>  Plane Mirror</title>
    <p>
   A plane mirror is a highly smoothed flat surface or a glass plate. One side of the  plate 
   is silver coated and is called a <em>silvered surface</em>, another side of it is highly smoothed 
   (fine polished) from which light beam undergoes a regular reflection to form an image and is 
   called a <em>reflecting surface</em> as shown in <xref ref="pimage"/>. In other words, 
   if a reflecting surface is  plane or if radius of curvature of the surface is infinite 
   then it behaves like a mirror, and is called a <term>plane mirror</term>. Any thing from which 
   light rays emanate and incident to the mirror is called an <term>object</term>. 
   The reflected rays from the mirror either actually converge to a point or appear to 
   diverge from a point. The point of intersection of reflected rays is called an <term>image</term>.

    <p>
      When an object, O is placed in front of a plane mirror, MN an image I is formed behind the mirror. 
      To determine how an image is formed, we need to consider at least two light rays that emanate 
      from the object, O. Consider the ray, OA which makes an angle of incidence, i with the normal to 
      the mirror. By the law of reflection, this ray is reflected along AB such that the angle of 
      reflection is r. When these reflected light rays enters into the observer's eye it appears 
      to have come from behind the mirror from point, I as indicated by the dashed line. The second 
      incident ray, OC is reflected along CD. To an observer in front of the mirror at D this reflected 
      ray also appears to come from the same point I behind the mirror, as indicated by the dashed line.  
      The two reflected  rays appear to have come from the point I  behind the mirror where the two 
      dashed lines intersect. The point I is called the image of the object O.  The distance from 
      the image to the mirror is called the image distance and is designated by the letter q. 
      The image is called a virtual image because the light rays do not actually come from that point,
      they only appear to come from that point. If you were to walk behind the mirror, you would not 
      find any real image there. A real image can be projected onto a screen while a virtual image cannot. 
      In general, a real image is one on which all the rays are converging, while a virtual image is 
      one from which all the rays are diverging. Thus, rays AB and CD are diverging away from the 
      virtual image I and will never cross on the left-hand side of the mirror. We should also note 
      that there is a third ray that can be used. This is the ray that is perpendicular to the mirror. 
      Since its angle of incidence is zero, its reflected angle is also zero, and the ray is reflected 
      back along the normal. This ray appears to come from directly behind the mirror and is also 
      indicated by a dashed line that comes from the image point I.
    </p>
    <p>
      An image formed by a plane mirror is virtual, object distance is equal to image distance, 
      and the size of image is the same as the size of object.

      From the geometry of the <xref ref="pimage"/> 
      <me>
        \angle NAB = \angle PIA =r \quad \text{corresponding angles are equal}

      <me>
        \angle POA = \angle OAN = i \quad \text{alternating angles are equal}
      </me>
      Hence in <m>\bigtriangleup^{s} OPA</m> and <m>IPA</m>, we have

<me>
  \angle POA = \angle PIA \quad [\text{law of reflection}]
</me>
<me>
  \therefore \quad \bigtriangleup OPA \cong \bigtriangleup IPA 
</me>
In congruent triangles corresponding arms are equal  hence, object distance, OP is equal to 
image distance, IP. Since no light rays are really passing through the point I constituting a 
virtual image. To understand the size of the image formed by a plane mirror let us consider 
an extended object P as shown in <xref ref="linversion"/>. Because object distance is equal to 
image distance the rays from each point of an object reflected from the mirror in such 
a way that they appear to come from the side wise inverted image behind the mirror. 
Hence a letter p looks like q in image. The process of inversion of left side of an object 
as its right side of its mirror image is known as a <term>lateral inversion</term>. 
From the <xref ref="linversion"/> it is clearly seen that the each rays from the object p 
incident normally onto the mirror and get reflected also normally so that each rays 
are parallel to each other. Which verifies the size of the image is equal to the size of 
the object. When the plane mirror is rotated through an angle <m>\theta</m>, the reflected 
ray turns through <m>2\theta</m> keeping the incident ray constant, as shown in <xref ref="rotatedmir"/>.

      In <xref ref="rotatedmir"/>, <m>\angle POL = g,</m> is called glancing angle. 
      It is the angle made by the incident ray with the reflecting surface so that <m>g+i=90^{o}</m>. 
      Now <m>\angle MOQ =g=\angle POL</m>, vertically opposite angle and <m>\angle ROM = g.</m> 
      Since <m>i=r</m> and <m>r+g=90^{o},</m> i.e, <m>\angle ROQ = 2g</m>. Once the mirror, LM 
      is rotated by an angle <m>\theta</m> and takes the position L'M' then the new glancing is 
      <m>g+\theta</m> and <m>\angle R'OQ = 2(g+\theta)</m>.

      The point on the principle axis through which the reflected rays of all the incident rays

      of the mirror as shown in <xref ref="concavemir2"/> and <xref ref="convexmir2"/>. 
      The size of the mirror is called the <term>aperture</term> of the mirror. If the aperture 
      of a mirror is small then reflected rays of any beam parallel to the principle axis either 
      must pass through  or appear to diverge from the focus of the the mirror. In the case of 
      a mirror of large aperture these reflected rays fail to meet at a single focus point, 
      such inability of a mirror to focus all the reflected rays of a parallel incident beam 
      at a single point is called geometrical or <em>spherical aberration</em> of the mirror. 
      The light rays that lie close to the principal axis are called <em>paraxial rays</em> 
      and they only able to meet at a single focus after reflection from the mirror. 
      The rays that lie far from the principal axis are called <em>marginal rays</em> 
      and after reflection  they cross the principle axis before focus point. Hence, the 
      reflection of large beam of light from the spherical mirror of large aperture creates 
      a curved shape of light called a <term>caustic curve</term> as shown in <xref ref="caustic"/>. 
      The cusp of caustic curves lie at the focus of the mirror. Spherical aberration can be 
      minimized by using a mirror of small aperture which is smaller compared to its radius of 
      curvature. Parabolic mirror will also minimize such spherical aberration.

  <title> Mirror Formula</title>

  An expression which shows the relation between object distance, image distance, and focal length of a

  The aperture of the mirror is small and the object should be placed on the principal axis.

  Let an object AB is placed on the principle axis as shown in <xref ref="mirform"/>. 
  Consider a ray of light BM incident on the mirror parallel  to the principle axis and 
  after reflection passes through the focus F and goes along FB'. Another ray from B passes 
  through the focus F, incident on the mirror at N and after reflection meets FB' at B'. 
  So that A'B' is the real image of the object AB. Draw perpendicular from points M and N  on the principle axis. 
  Now, from similar <m>\vartriangle ABF</m> and <m>\vartriangle PNF</m> 
  <me>
    \frac{AB}{PN}=\frac{AF}{PF}

  In similar triangles the ratio of corresponding sides are equal.

  \frac{u-f}{f} = \frac{f}{v-f}

    The image is formed at focus and will be real, inverted, and point in size. Using mirror formula,
