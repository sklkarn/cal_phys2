  <title>Electrostatic Induction</title>

  <introduction>
    
     <p>
      A redistribution of charges in a neutral object when a charged object is brought 
      near it is called an electrostatic induction. Neighboring charges which are brought 
      near a neutral object are known as <em>inducing charges</em>, charges developed on a 
      neutral object are known as <em>induced charges</em>. Induced charges closer to 
      the inducing charges are known as <em>bound charges</em> and charges away from 
      inducing charges are known as <em>free charges</em> (<xref ref="fig2"/>).

  <title>Methods of Transferring Charges:</title>
 <introduction>
  <p>
    Charge can neither be created nor be destroyed but  it can be transferred from one 
    object to another by the following processes. 
    <ol>
      <li>
        <term>Charging by Friction:</term> In this method two neutral objects are rubbed 
        together against each other to transfer charges from one object to another. 
        The object which gains electrons becomes negatively charged and the one which 
        looses electrons becomes positively charged. 
      </li>
      <li>
       <term> Charging by Conduction:</term> In this method charged object are brought in 
       contact to the other object to transfer charges. Uncharged object becomes charged 
       after touching by the charged object. When oppositely charged object brought in contact 
       with each other they lose their charges.	
      </li>
      <li>
       <term> Charging by Induction:</term> In this method an uncharged object is brought 
       near a charged object (no physical contact) to induce a positive and negative charge 
       on it. When charged object is in proximity of uncharged object it produces an 
       electrical force on electrons to move them from one part of object to another. 
       When an insulator is brought near a charged object electrons of insulator atoms 
       experience electrical force which stretches atoms to  displace center of gravity of
        positive charges and negative charges. This phenomenon of separation of charges is 
        called <em>polarization</em>. Hence in induction positive charges are separated 
        from negative charges to produce charges on an object.

    It is a device used to produce charges using electrostatic induction. 
    It consists of an insulating base plate and a conducting disc (also known as electrophorus disc) 
    with an insulated handle [<xref ref="fig3"/>]. At first insulating plate is rubbed with silk, 
    fur, or wool which produces charges on the plate depending on the type of materials being 
    rubbed together. In the figure above negative charges are produced on the base plate. 
    Electrophorus disk is then brought in contact with this plate and then grounded. 
    Grounding help free charges on disk to neutralize with the opposite charges from the 
    earth (ground). Earth is an infinite source of charges and because electrons are lighter 
    than the positive charges electrons can easily come from earth to the disk to neutralize 
    free positive charges or they can leave the disc to the ground if they are free charges. 
    After grounding, the disk contains only one kind of charges, it is then disconnected from 
    ground before get removed from the plate. All the charges on the disk then spread around 
    its surface which can be stored and used as needed. In this case positive charges are stored from the disk.

    It is an instrument used to detect charge on a body.  It consists of two gold 
    (or silver or aluminum) leaves suspended from a conducting rod that leads to the 
    outside of an insulating glass container (<xref ref="electroscope"/>). 
    The rod has metallic ball attached at its top, when a charged object is 
    brought near the conducting ball or make in contact with it causes the leaves 
    to diverge because like charges repel each other. The nature of charge (positive 
    or negative) on any object can also be determined with the help of electroscope,
     by making its leaves charged with the known charges.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-coulmb_law">
  <title>Coulumb's Law</title>
 <introduction>
  <p>
    The force of attraction or repulsion between any two point charges is directly proportional 
    to the product of these charges and inversely proportional to the square of distance between them. 
    The direction of force is always acting along the line joining these two point charges. 
    If <m>F_{12}</m> is a force acting on charge <m> q_{1}</m> due to charge <m> q_{2},</m> 
    <m>F_{21}</m> is a force acting on charge <m> q_{2}</m> due to charge <m>q_{1},</m> 
    and <m> r_{12} </m> is a distance between the two charges (<xref ref="fig4"/>) then from Coulumb's law 
    <me>
      \vec{F}  =  k\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}\hat{r} =  \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{o}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}\hat{r}
    </me>
    where <m>\hat{r}</m> is unit vector along line joining the two charges, Coulomb's constant of free space, 
    <m>k  =  9.00 \times 10^{9} \,N m^{2}/C^{2}</m>;  and permittivity of free space, 
    <m>\epsilon_{o}  =  8.85 \times 10^{-12}\,C^{2}/N m^{2}.</m> 
    Permittivity is an ability of a medium to store electrical energy in an electric field. 
    In other words, permittivity is the extent to which a medium permits electrical lines of force 
    between the charges. It is a resistance of a medium in forming electric fields. It describes 
    the effect of a material in an electrical field. The higher the permittivity, the more the 
    material tends to reduce electrical field (due to polarization) that set up it.

 <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-1d_colmb">
  <title>Coulumb's Law in One Dimension</title>
  <p>
    Coulomb's law holds good only for two point charges but if more than two charges are 
    located in space then the force on each of them can be determined by using the principle of superposition.
  </p>

 <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-2d_colmb">
  <title>Coulomb's Law in Two and Three Dimensions</title>
  <p>
    Use principle of superposition to obtain force on any charge if the charges are distributed at different points in space.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-superp_th">
  <title>Principle of Superposition</title>
  <p>
    It states that every charge in space exerts a force on another in such a way 
    that there are no other chrages present in that medium. Hence, the net force 
    excerted at a point charge by two or more charges in space is a vector sum 
    of the individual forces.
