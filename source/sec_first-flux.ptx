  <title>Electric Flux</title>
  
<introduction>
  <p>
    Flux is the rate of flow of field normally through an imaginary surface. 
    If <m>\,dV</m> is the volume of water that is flowing through a tube of cross-section <m>A</m> 
    normally in time <m>\,dt,</m> then the flux of water through this tube is given by 
    <me>
      \phi=\frac{\,dV}{\,dt}= \frac{A\,dx}{\,dt} = \vec{v}\cdot \vec{A}
    </me>
    Where <m>v</m> is the velocity of flow of water in the tube. 
    <em>Electric flux</em> can also be defined as number of electric field lines 
    passing through any surface perpendicularly.  Electric flux passes through an 
    elementary surface area, <m>\,dA</m> is given by  
    <me>
      \Phi_{E}= \int\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,dA} 	= \int E\cos\phi \,dA = \int E_{x}\,dA_{yz}+\int E_{y}\,dA_{xz}+\int E_{z}\,dA_{xy}

  <title>Gauss'ss Law</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      It states that the total electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the 
      total electric charge enclosed by this surface., i.e., 
      <men xml:id="eqn-gauss_law1">
        \Phi_{E} =  \oint\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,dA}  = \frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_{o}}
      </men>
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
          Suppose a charge <m>q</m> is enclosed by the two closed surfaces <m>S</m> and <m>S'</m> then 
          number of lines crossing the surface <m>S</m> = number of lines crossing the surface <m>S'.</m>  But, 
          the number of lines per unit area through a surface perpendicular to the lines is proportional to the 
          strength of the electric field at a given region, i.e., 
          line density is proportional to the electric field, <m>E(r)</m>. 
      </p>

      <p> 
        where, line density = <m>= \frac{\text{No. of lines}}{Area_{\bot}}</m>
      </p> 
      <p>         
          or, No. of lines = line density. <m>Area_{\bot}</m>
           </p>
           <p>
           or, line crossing the surface S =<m>\Phi_{s}</m> =<m> K\cdot E(r) \cdot Area_{\bot}</m>
            where K is a proportionality constant. Hence, 
            <men xml:id="eqn-gauss_law2">
              \Phi_{s}= K.E(r). 4\pi r^{2} 
            </men>
            and for surface S', the flux
            <men xml:id="eqn-gauss_law3">
              \Phi_{s'} = \iint\limits_{s'}\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,dA}   
            </men>
              </p>
              <p>
                From eqns. <xref ref="eqn-gauss_law2"/> and <xref ref="eqn-gauss_law3"/> we get- 
                <me>
                  K.E(r).4\pi\, r^{2} = \iint\limits_{s'}\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,dA}
                </me>
                <me>
                  \text{or,}\quad K\left(\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_{o}r^{2}}\right).4\pi \,r^{2} \iint\limits_{s'}\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,dA}
                </me>
                In SI unit, set constant, K = 1, 
                <me>
                  \therefore \quad \frac{q}{\epsilon_{o}}= \iint\limits_{surface}\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,dA}  = \Phi_{E}
                </me> <fn>all integrals used here are closed surface integrals.</fn>
                Which is a Gauss's law. Gauss's law is applicable for any surface as long as the charge distribution 
                is symmetrical for the surface. It can be used to find the electric field due to a point charge, 
                a spherically symmetric charge distribution, a uniform rod of charge, and a uniform sheet of charge. 
                It is not applicable for a charge distribution in pyramid type surface or a finite disc or rod. 
                An imaginary surface symmetrical to charge distribution considered at any point where electric field 
                is to be determined is called <term>Gaussian Surface</term>.

    Using Gauss's law to find the electric field:  
    <ol marker="i.">
      <li>
        Use the symmetry of the charge distribution to determine the direction of the 
        resulting electric field and to determine where that field is constant in magnitude.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pick part of your Gaussian surface to be perpendicular to the electric field where 
        its magnitude, E is constant. The flux through this surface is then simply E 
        times the area of that surface. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If possible, pick another part of your Gaussian surface to be inside a conductor so that E = 0. 
        The flux through this surface is then simply zero. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Pick the rest of your Gaussian surface to be parallel to the electric field where E 
        is not constant. The flux through this surface is then simply zero. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the total flux through your Gaussian surface equal to the total charge enclosed divided by <m>\epsilon_{o}.</m> 
      </li>
      <li>
        Solve the resulting equation for the magnitude of the electric field. 
        Combine this with the direction determined earlier to obtain the vector electric field.

        \phi=\oint\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,ds}= E_{o}4\pi r^{2} =\frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_{o}}

        \therefore\quad E_{o} = \left(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{o}}\right) \frac{Q}{r^{2}}= k\frac{Q}{r^{2}}
