  <title>Electric Flux</title>
  
<introduction>
  <p>
    Flux is the rate of flow of field normally through an imaginary surface. 
    If <m>\,dV</m> is the volume of water that is flowing through a tube of cross-section <m>A</m> 
    normally in time <m>\,dt,</m> then the flux of water through this tube is given by 
    <me>
      \phi=\frac{\,dV}{\,dt}= \frac{A\,dx}{\,dt} = \vec{v}\cdot \vec{A}
    </me>
    Where <m>v</m> is the velocity of flow of water in the tube. 
    <em>Electric flux</em> can also be defined as number of electric field lines 
    passing through any surface perpendicularly.  Electric flux passes through an 
    elementary surface area, <m>\,dA</m> is given by  
    <me>
      \Phi_{E}= \int\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,dA} 	= \int E\cos\phi \,dA = \int E_{x}\,dA_{yz}+\int E_{y}\,dA_{xz}+\int E_{z}\,dA_{xy}

  <title>Gauss's Law</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      It states that the total electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the 
      total electric charge enclosed by this surface., i.e., 
      <men xml:id="eqn-gauss_law1">
        \Phi_{E} =  \oint\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,dA}  = \frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_{o}}
      </men>
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
          Suppose a charge <m>q</m> is enclosed by the two closed surfaces <m>S</m> and <m>S'</m> then 
          number of lines crossing the surface <m>S</m> = number of lines crossing the surface <m>S'.</m>  But, 
          the number of lines per unit area through a surface perpendicular to the lines is proportional to the 
          strength of the electric field at a given region, i.e., 
          line density is proportional to the electric field, <m>E(r)</m>. 
      </p>

        where, line density = <m>= \frac{\text{No. of lines}}{Area_{\bot}}</m>
      </p> 
      <p>         
          or, No. of lines = line density. <m>Area_{\bot}</m>
           </p>
           <p>
           or, line crossing the surface S =<m>\Phi_{s}</m> =<m> K\cdot E(r) \cdot Area_{\bot}</m>
            where K is a proportionality constant. Hence, 
            <men xml:id="eqn-gauss_law2">
              \Phi_{s}= K.E(r). 4\pi r^{2}

              <p>
                From eqns. <xref ref="eqn-gauss_law2"/> and <xref ref="eqn-gauss_law3"/> we get-

                In SI unit, set constant, K = 1, 
                <me>
                  \therefore \quad \frac{q}{\epsilon_{o}}= \iint\limits_{surface}\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,dA}  = \Phi_{E}
                </me> <fn>all integrals used here are closed surface integrals.</fn>
                Which is a Gauss's law. Gauss's law is applicable for any surface as long as the charge distribution 
                is symmetrical for the surface. It can be used to find the electric field due to a point charge, 
                a spherically symmetric charge distribution, a uniform rod of charge, and a uniform sheet of charge. 
                It is not applicable for a charge distribution in pyramid type surface or a finite disc or rod. 
                An imaginary surface symmetrical to charge distribution considered at any point where electric field 
                is to be determined is called <term>Gaussian Surface</term>.

    Using Gauss's law to find the electric field:  
    <ol marker="i.">
      <li>
        Use the symmetry of the charge distribution to determine the direction of the 
        resulting electric field and to determine where that field is constant in magnitude.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pick part of your Gaussian surface to be perpendicular to the electric field where 
        its magnitude, E is constant. The flux through this surface is then simply E 
        times the area of that surface. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If possible, pick another part of your Gaussian surface to be inside a conductor so that E = 0. 
        The flux through this surface is then simply zero. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Pick the rest of your Gaussian surface to be parallel to the electric field where E 
        is not constant. The flux through this surface is then simply zero. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the total flux through your Gaussian surface equal to the total charge enclosed divided by <m>\epsilon_{o}.</m> 
      </li>
      <li>
        Solve the resulting equation for the magnitude of the electric field.

      Consider a symmetrical cylindrical Gaussian surface around the charge on an 
      infinitely charged sheet of surface charge density is <m>\sigma </m> as shown in <xref ref="fig21"/>. 
      Now electric flux, <m>\phi </m> through the surfaces <m>S_{1}, \quad S_{2},</m> and <m>S_{3}</m> is given by 
      <me>
        \phi=\phi_{1}+\phi_{2}+\phi_{3}
      </me>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad \phi=\int \vec{E}_{1}\cdot\vec{\,ds}_{1}+\int \vec{E}_{2}\cdot\vec{\,ds}_{2}+\int \vec{E}_{3}\cdot\vec{\,ds}_{3}
      </me>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad \phi = E_{1}A +E_{2}A + 0
      </me>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad \phi = (E_{1} +E_{2})A 
      </me>
       But from Gauss's law,
       <me>
        \phi=\frac{\,dq}{\epsilon_{o}} = \frac{\sigma A}{\epsilon_{o}}
       </me>
        <me>
          \therefore \quad (E_{1} +E_{2})A = \frac{\sigma A}{\epsilon_{o}}
        </me>
        <me>
          \text{or,}\quad (E_{1} +E_{2})=\frac{\sigma }{\epsilon_{o}}
        </me>
        Now because of surface symmetry around the charge 
        <me>
          E_{1}=E_{2} =E
        </me>
       <me>
        \therefore \quad E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_{o}}
       </me>
         That is, field is independent upon the distance of the point as long as the point is 
         not significantly far away.  Electric field is normal to the charged sheet except at 
         the edges where it is emitting radially out ward in all possible directions. 
         Hence, Gaussian law can not be applied to determined field at a point for a finite charged conductor.

    <title>Electric field just outside a charged conductor</title>
    <p>
      Consider a conductor of any shape AB has given a charge q. This charge will redistribute under 
      electrostatic equilibrium on a conductor in such a way that the field inside the conductor is 
      zero i.e., <m>E_{in}=0.</m> Now consider a point P just outside of the conductor and <m>\sigma</m> 
      be the surface charge density of the conductor.

    <p>
      Now consider a small cylindrical Gaussian surface CD having the base C passing through P, 
      the other side D lying inside the conductor and the curved surface being perpendicular to 
      the surface of the conductor.  The flux through the curved surface is zero since there 
      is no component of electric field normal to the curved surface. Also the flux through the 
      base D is zero as electric field inside the conductor is zero. Therefore the resultant 
      flux of the entire surface of the Gaussian cylinder is the same as the flux through the 
      face C which is equal to  
      <me>
        \phi=\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,ds} =E\,ds=\frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_{o}}
      </me>
     <me>
      \text{or,}\quad E\,ds =  \frac{\sigma\,ds}{\epsilon_{o}}; 
     </me>
     <me>
      \therefore\quad E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_{o}}
     </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the electric field at any point close to the surface of a charged conductor of any shape 
          is equal to <m>\frac{1}{\epsilon_{o}}</m> times the surface charge density <m>\sigma</m>. 
          If <m>\sigma</m> is positive, electric field is directed away from the conductor and if 
          it is negative, then field is directed towards the conductor. Obviously field near a plane 
          conductor is twice of the field in front of a non-conducting thin sheet of charge.
