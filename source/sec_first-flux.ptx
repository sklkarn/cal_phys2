  <title>Electric Flux</title>
  
<introduction>
  <p>
    Flux is the rate of flow of field normally through an imaginary surface. 
    If <m>\,dV</m> is the volume of water that is flowing through a tube of cross-section <m>A</m> 
    normally in time <m>\,dt,</m> then the flux of water through this tube is given by 
    <me>
      \phi=\frac{\,dV}{\,dt}= \frac{A\,dx}{\,dt} = \vec{v}\cdot \vec{A}
    </me>
    \Where <m>v</m> is the velocity of flow of water in the tube. 
    <em>Electric flux</em> can also be defined as number of electric field lines 
    passing through any surface perpendicularly.  Electric flux passes through an 
    elementary surface area, <m>\,dA</m> is given by  
    <me>
      \Phi_{E}= \int\vec{E}\cdot\vec{\,dA} 	= \int E\cos\phi \,dA = \int E_{x}\,dA_{yz}+\int E_{y}\,dA_{xz}+\int E_{z}\,dA_{xy}
