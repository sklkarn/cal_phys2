  <title>Sound</title>
  

  <introduction>
    <p>
      It is a kind of energy which is produced when medium vibrates. It is a mechanical 
      wave and creates pressure on a layer of medium when propagates, hence it is also 
      called a pressure wave. Sound wave is longitudinal in nature. When such energy reaches 
      to animal eardrum, it begins to vibrate and animal has sensation of hearing. 
      The physical character of sound depends upon the listener's audible perception. 
      The physical quantity that defines the loudness is a sound pressure and the quantity 
      that defines the timbre or quality of sound is a frequency, f, measured in cycles 
      per second, or Hertz (Hz). A sound of frequency 20 Hz to 20 kHz is audible to 
      healthy human ear. Loudness increases with the increase of pressure amplitude 
      at a given frequency.  <term>Loudness or Intensity Level</term> is a sound energy 
      received by a unit area of listener's eardrum (detector) in unit time. Loudness is a 
      listener's perception. <term>Intensity</term> is an energy carried by a  wave 
      per unit area per unit time. Intensity is a property of sound producing device. 
      Loudness is an intensity received by a listener.

      Sound Wave Equations are 
      <me>
        s(x,t) = s_{o} sin (kx-\omega t) \quad	(Displacement) 
      </me>
       	<me>
          p(x,t) = Bks_{o} cos (kx-\omega t) \quad	(Pressure) 
        </me>
        <me>
          p_{max} = |Bks_{o}|	\quad \text{(Pressure Amplitude)}
        </me>
              Now sound intensity can be 	
              <me>
                I = \frac{P}{A}	(W/m^{2}) = \frac{\,E}{A\,dt}=\frac{F \,ds}{A\,dt} = p(x,t)v(x,t)=Bk\omega s_{o}^{2}\cos^{2}(\omega t-kx)
              </me>
              At any point x the average value of function <m>\cos^{2}(\omega t-kx) </m> 
              over one period <m>T=2\pi/\omega</m> is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. 
              <me>
                \therefore\quad  I = \frac{1}{2}Bk\omega s_{o}^{2} = \frac{\omega p_{max}^{2}}{2Bk}=\frac{v p_{max}^{2}}{2B}
              </me>
              <me>
                \text{But,}\quad v=\sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}\quad \text{hence}\quad  I = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\rho B}\omega^{2}s_{o}^{2}
              </me>
              <me>
                \text{or,}\quad I = \frac{p^{2}_{max}}{2\rho v} = \frac{p^{2}_{max}}{2\sqrt{\rho B}}
              </me>
               </p>
               <p>
                Intensity level or loudness is measured in logarithmic scale as it depends upon 
                human perception of sound, i.e 
                <me>
                  \beta =  10 \log\frac{I}{I_{o}} \quad (dB)
                </me>
            The unit of loudness is decibels (dB) and the term 
            <m>I_{o} = 10^{-12} \,(W/m^{2})</m> is a minimum intensity of sound that human ear 
            can perceive with zero loudness. <m>I_{o}</m> is also known as 
            <term>Threshold of hearing</term> as <m>\beta=0</m> at <m>I=I_{o}</m>.
               </p>
               <p>
                A decibel is one tenth of a bel, <m>B</m>. The unit bel is taken to give 
                honor to a telephone inventor Alexendor Graham Bell. Since Bel is an inconveniently 
                large unit so we use decibel. A typical conversation occurs at 60 to 70 dB pleasant 
                to hear. A sound from nearby storm is 120 dB may cause severe damage to the eardrum. 
                Intensity level follows the <term>inverse square law</term>. That is 
                <me>
                  I \propto \frac{1}{r^{2}};
                </me>
               <m>\left[\because I = \frac{P}{A}=\frac{P}{4\pi r^{2}}\right]</m> 
               where r is the distance from the source.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-echo">
    <title>Reverberation and Echo</title>
    <p>
      Echo and reverberation are two distinct phenomenon of sound waves which occur 
      due to its reflection from any surfaces. Sound endures in our brain 
      (or we have the memory that sound being in existence for) longer than 0.1 
      second. If  sound is reflected from any surface reaches to our ear within 0.1 
      seconds of the initial sound, then it seems that the sound is prolonged. 
      The reception of reflected sound within 0.1 second causes the 
      reverberation - the prolonging of a sound. The speed of sound in air is about 340 m/s 
      at ambient temperature. If the wall of a room is 17 meter away from the source of 
      sound then it reflects back from the wall and reaches to the ear within 0.1 s. 
      <me>
       \left[ t = \frac{d}{v}=\frac{2\times 17 \,m}{340 \,m/s}=0.1 \,s\right]
      </me>
       hence causing a prolonged sound effect, called a reverberation. 
    </p>
    <p>Echoes are also the effect of reflection of sound waves perceived by the ear. 
      When a reflected sound wave reaches the ear after 0.1 seconds of the original 
      sound was heard then  echoes are produced. If the elapsed time between the arrivals 
      of the two sound waves is more than 0.1 seconds, then the sensation of the first 
      sound will have died out. In other words, echo is a sensation of second sound wave 
      after the effect of original sound wave will vanish. It is not a prolonging of the 
      original sound wave as in reverberation.   </p>

    <title>Beats</title>
    <p>
      The phenomenon of producing a maximum loudness periodically when two sound waves of 
      same amplitude and slightly different frequencies are superimposed is known as  <term>beats</term>. 
      The frequency of the beats depends upon the difference in frequency of the two waves. 
      If the frequency difference is larger than 20 Hz, a tone is usually perceived separately 
      rather than distinct beats. Beat frequency is given by 	
      <me>
        f_{beat} = \Delta f = |f_{a} -f_{b}| 
      </me>
      where <m>f_{a}</m> and <m>f_{b} </m> are frequencies of the two waves. When two such 
      waves superimpose there is a variation in amplitude of resulting wave which causes the 
      change in loudness and hence the beats are produced.

     varies slowly with <m>\frac{\omega_{a} -\omega_{b}}{2}</m>. The frequency of this second term is 
     <m>\frac{f_{a} -f_{b}}{2}</m>, but the ear cannot hear the inversion of phase that occurs when phase 
     is negative and the difference is small. This term is responsible for the beating effect, 
     and is known as an envelope. The sine factor varies with a frequency 
     <me>
      \omega_{d}=\frac{\omega_{a} +\omega_{b}}{2}.
     </me>
     There are two times that the envelope (cosine term) passes through zero for every wavelength, 
     so the beat frequency is twice the frequency of the envelope and is given by the magnitude of 
     the difference of the two frequencies, i.e.,  beat frequency

    <title>Doppler Effect</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The Doppler effect is the change in perceived frequency of a source due to the relative motion 
      between the source and the receiver. It applies to all sorts of waves. Doppler effect can be 
      experienced as the change in frequency or <term>pitch</term> received when an ambulance passes by. 
      When the ambulence is approaching, the pitch of siren is getting higher than the actual frequency 
      of siren. When the ambulence passes by, the frequency sounds the same as the actual emitted 
      frequency and when the ambulance is moving away, the pitch is getting lower than the actual 
      emitted frequency. When the source of the waves is coming towards the observer, observer receives 
      more waves every second compared to being at rest. That is waves bunch together for the observer 
      giving impression for the decrease of wavelength and causing an increase in the frequency. 
      Conversely, if the source of waves is going away from the observer, observer receives less waves 
      every second compared to being at rest. That is waves <em>spread out</em> for the observer giving 
      impression for the increase of wavelength and causing a decrease in the frequency as shown in <xref ref="deb"/>. 
      Since the velocity of sound is comparable to the listener's velocity and it propagates only in medium, 
      Doppler effect may be the consequence of motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium. 
      Each of these effects is analyzed separately. For waves which do not require a medium such as light, 
      only the relative velocity between the observer and the source needs to be considered.

  As source of sound moves there is a change in wavelength perceived by the listener and if

    <title>Sonic Boom</title>
    <p>
     A loud noise that is created by the <em>shock wave</em> is called a sonic boom. 
     When source of sound is traveling faster than the speed of sound then it produces 
     a sonic boom. Any thing moving faster than the speed of sound is called a supersonic speed. 
     An aircraft which is going at subsonic speeds (lower than that of sound), its sound wave 
     is radiated in all directions in such a way that the individual wavefronts are bunched 
     at he front of the aircraft and spread at the back of it because of forward motion of 
     the aircraft as shown in <xref ref="subsonic"/>. This effect is well known  as Doppler effect 
     which changes the <em> pitch</em> of the aircraft's sound as it passes us. When the plane 
     is approaching us its sound has a higher pitch than if it is going away from us. 
     If the aircraft is traveling with the same speed as that of sound (called sonic speed) 
     then the aircraft is at the leading edge of wavefronts that it produces as shown in <xref ref="sonic"/>.  
     All the wavefronts are bunched up at the front of the aircraft. This phenomenon is known as 
     a shock wave. If the aircraft is traveling at the supersonic speeds, then a pressure wave 
     is produced in the shape of the cone whose vertex is at the nose of the aircraft, 
     and whose base is behind the plane. The angle opening of the cone depends on the actual 
     speed the plane is traveling at. All of the sound pressure is contained in this cone 
     as shown in <xref ref="supersonic"/>. Now imagine that this aircraft is in a level flight. 
     Before the aircraft passes you, you can only see it but you can not hear anything. 
     The pressure cone is trailing behind the aircraft. Once your ears intersect the edge 
     of this cone, your will hear a very loud sound - the sonic boom. Therefore you will 
     hear the sonic boom once your ears intersect this cone.

      numbers approximately equal to one and are described as transonic. The angle at the vertex 
      of shock waves is called  <term>Mach angle</term>.

        \sin\alpha = \frac{height}{hypotenuse} = \frac{v t}{v_{s}t}=\frac{v }{v_{s}}

      where t is the time taken by the sound to reach the ground when aircraft travels 
      the horizontal distance of <m>v_{s} t</m>.

      When an object travels slower than the spped of sound, the Mach angle is greater than one, 
      and the equation does not have a real solution. This is because there is no shock wave at 
      subsonic speeds. Traveling at the speed of sound makes the ratio equal one and results in a 
      Mach angle of ninety degrees. At transonic speeds the shock wave is a wall of high pressure 
      moving with the object, perpendicular to its velocity. Above the speed of sound, the ratio is 
      less than one and the Mach angle is less than ninety degrees. The faster the object moves, 
      the narrower the cone of high pressure behind it becomes. Measuring the vertex angle is 
      thus a simple way to determine the speed of a supersonic object.
