  <title>Dispersion</title>
  

  <introduction>
   <p>
    The phenomenon of splitting of white light into its constituent colors when passes through a 
    prism is known as <term>dispersion</term> and the image thus formed on a screen is called a 
    <term>spectrum</term>. The spectrum consists of a visible and invisible regions of light. 
    The principal colors of light in the visible spectrum are given as <em>VIBGYOR</em> 
    (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red). The deviation occurred in violet 
    light is maximum and that for red light is minimum as shown in <xref ref="dispers"/>. 
    In the invisible regions, the spectrum of wavelengths shorter than violet is called 
    <em>ultra-violet</em> and that for longer than red is called <em>infra-red</em>.

    The refractive index of the material for a prism is different for different wavelengths 
    (or colors) which is given by Cauchy's dispersion formula 
    <me>
      \eta = A+\frac{B}{\lambda^{2}}.
    </me>
    The values of A and B depend on the medium and is called Cauchy's constants. 
    Since 
    <me>
      \eta \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}
    </me>
     the violet light suffers the greatest deviation and red light suffers the least deviation 
     in visible light spectrum. The color of light is dependent on its wavelength, <m>\lambda</m>. 
     Here is a list of wavelengths 
     <me>
      \lambda_{red}=620-750\,nm,
    </me>
    <me>
      \lambda_{orange}=590-620\,nm,
    </me>
   <me>
    \lambda_{yellow}=570-620\,nm,
   </me>
   <me>
    \lambda_{green}=495-620\,nm,
   </me>
    <me>
      \lambda_{blue}=450-495\,nm,
    </me>
    <me>
      \lambda_{red}=380-450\,nm.
    </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        When a white light is passing through a thin prism, then deviation produced by blue, yellow, and red light is given by 
        <men xml:id="eqn-dispers1">
          \delta=A(\eta-1)\qquad \text{for mean yellow light} 
        </men>
        <men xml:id="eqn-dispers2">
          \delta_{b}=A(\eta_{b}-1)\qquad \text{for blue light} 
        </men>
        <men xml:id="eqn-dispers3">
          \delta_{r}=A(\eta_{r}-1)\qquad \text{for red light} 
        </men>
      where A is a refracting angle of the prism. The difference in deviation between any two colors 
      is called <term>angular dispersion, <m>\theta</m></term>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        From eqns. <xref ref="eqn-dispers2"/> and <xref ref="eqn-dispers3"/> 
        <me>
          \theta = \delta_{b}-\delta_{r}=A(\eta_{b}-\eta_{r})
        </me>
        Dividing this expression by eqn. <xref ref="eqn-dispers1"/>, we get - 
        <men xml:id="eqn-dispers4">
          \frac{\theta}{\delta}=\frac{\delta_{b}-\delta_{r}}{\delta}=\frac{\eta_{b}-\eta_{r}}{\eta -1}= \frac{\,d\eta}{\eta -1}=\omega 
        </men>
       The ratio of angular dispersion between violet and red emergent rays and the deviation suffered by the 
       mean ray is known as the dispersive power of the material of a prism. It is constant for any two colors (wavelengths). 
      </p>
     
      <p>
        Newton once combined the two similar prisms upside down sidewise and passed the white 
        light through them. He observed that as the white light  passed through the first prism 
        splitted into constituent colors and as these colors passed through the second inverted 
        prism the emergent light beam recombines back into white light as shown in <xref ref="dispers2"/>. 
        This experiment suggests that the white light consists of different colors of light 
        which are seperated when passes through the prism.

    <title>Deviation Without Dispersion (Achromatic Prism)</title>
    <p>
      When two prisms of different materials are arranged in such a way that the final 
      emergent ray suffers only deviation but not dispersion, then the combination is 
      called the deviation without dispersion  as shown in <xref ref="dispers3"/>.

    The dispersive powers of different materials are different. The dispersive power of a flint glass 
    prism is higher than that of a crown glass prism hence angular dispersion produced by the flint 
    glass prism is greater than that by the crown glass prism of the same refracting angle. 
    If the materials and the angle of the prisms are so adjusted  that the dispersion produced by 
    the first prism is equal and opposite to that produced by the second prism, then the 
    final beam will be deviated but not dispersed for the white light. Such a combination of 
    the two prisms will produce deviation in the incident beam without dispersion. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider C and F are the crown and flint glass prisms of refracting angles  A and A', respectively. 
    Let <m>\eta_{b}</m>, <m> \eta</m>, <m>\eta_{r}</m> and <m>\eta'_{b}</m>, <m>\eta'</m>,  <m>\eta'_{r} </m>  
    be the refractive indices of the two materials for blue, mean and red light. The angular dispersion 
    for blue and red light produced by these prisms are given by 
    <me>
      \delta_{b}-\delta_{r}=A(\eta_{b}-\eta_{r}) \qquad \text{for crown glass prism}

    <me>
      \text{and}\quad \delta'_{b}-\delta'_{r}=A'(\eta'_{b}-\eta'_{r}) \qquad \text{for flint glass prism}
    </me>
    For no dispersion we should set 
    <me>

 The -ve sign indicates the refracting angles of the prisms are in opposite directions. 
 The combination of two such prisms which satisfies eqn. <xref ref="eqn-nodispers2"/> is called 
 an achromatic combination and a beam of white light refracted through the combination will only be deviated

  are the dispersive powers of the materials of crown and flint glass prisms respectively. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For the achromatism, the refracting angles of the two prisms are chosen different from 
    each other and hence the deviation produced by the combination for a mean light is given by 
    <men xml:id="eqn-nodispers3">
      D=\delta+\delta' =A(\eta-1)+A'(\eta'-1)

    <title>Chromatic Aberation in a Lens</title>
    <introduction>
     
    <p>
      In greek chroma means color and aberration means defect, hence the color defects of a lens is 
      called a chromatic aberration. In other words, the inability of a lens to focus all colors of 
      white light at a single focus is known as chromatic aberration. From lens maker's formula 
      it is clear that the focal length of a lens depend upon the refractive index of a material 
      of lens which is the cause of chromatic aberration. If white light is passing through the lens 
      violet color focuses at a point <m>F_{v}</m> near to the lens and the red color focuses at point 
      <m>F_{r}</m> far from the lens. The rays of intermediate colors are focused between these points 
      as shown in <xref ref="chrom_abrl"/>. Hence the image of an object emitting white light stretched between 
    <m>F_{v}</m> and <m>F_{r}</m> and is blurred. Chromatic aberration is of two types, axial (or longitudinal) 
    aberration and lateral (or transverse) aberration.

<p>
  The axial chromatic aberration is given by 
  <me>
    x=f_{r}-f_{b}.
  </me>
  Now the focal length of a lens is given by 
  <me>
    \frac{1}{f}=(\eta-1)\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right)
  </me>
  <me>
    \text{or,}\quad \left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right) = \frac{1}{f(\eta-1)}
  </me>
  <me>
    \text{Similarly,}\quad \frac{1}{f_{b}}=(\eta'_{b}-1)\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right)= \frac{(\eta'_{b}-1)}{f(\eta-1)}
  </me>
  <me>
    \text{Also,}\quad \frac{1}{f_{r}}=(\eta'_{r}-1)\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right)= \frac{(\eta'_{r}-1)}{f(\eta-1)}
  </me>
  Hence 
  <me>
    \frac{1}{f_{b}} -\frac{1}{f_{r}} = \frac{(\eta_{b}-1)-(\eta_{r}-1)}{f(\eta-1)}
  </me>
  <me>
    \text{or,}\quad \frac{f_{r}-f_{b}}{f_{b}f_{r}} =  \frac{\eta_{b}-\eta_{r}}{f(\eta-1)}
  </me>
  Taking 
  <me>
    f_{b}f_{r} =f^{2}
  </me>
   as f is a geometrical mean of <m>f_{b}</m> and <m>f_{r}</m> and <m>f</m> being the focal length of mean light, we have - 
   <me>
    f_{r}-f_{b} = \frac{(\eta_{b}-\eta_{r})f}{\eta-1}=\omega f
   </me>
   Hence it is clear that a single lens can not produce an image free from chromatic aberration 
   unless the dispersive power can be balanced by using some other material.

  <title>Achromatism</title>
  <p>
   The condition of removing chromatic aberration from a lens is called an achromatism. 
   When two lenses a convex lens and a concave lens of different materials are combined 
   in such a way that the combination will not produce any chromatic aberration then the 
   lens is called an achromatic lens. Suppose a crown glass convex lens and a flint glass 
   concave lens are combined together, then from lens formula 
   <me>
    \frac{1}{f} = (\eta -1)\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right)
   </me>
<me>
  \text{or,}\quad \left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right)=\frac{1}{(\eta -1)f}=K (say)
</me>
<me>
  \text{or,}\quad \frac{1}{f}= K(\eta-1)
</me>
    Differentiating, we get - 
    <me>
      -\frac{\,df}{f^{2}}=K\,d\eta 
    </me>
    <me>
      = \frac{\,d\eta}{f(\eta-1)}=\frac{\eta_{b}-\eta_{r}}{f(\eta-1)} = \frac{\omega}{f}

      \therefore\quad \omega=-\frac{\,df}{f}
    </me>
       That is the dispersive power can be defined as the relative change in the focal length of a 
       lens and the -ve sign indicates that the focal length of the lens decreases with increasing 
       refractive index of the material. If <m>f_{1}</m> and <m>f_{2}</m> are the focal lengths of 
       the two lenses of different materials (crown and flint) placed in contact coaxially, then 
       the equivalent focal length of the combination is given by 
       <me>
        \frac{1}{F}=\frac{1}{f_{1}}+\frac{1}{f_{2}}
       </me>
          Differentiating we get -

            -\frac{\,dF}{F^{2}}= -\frac{\,df_{1}}{f_{1}^{2}}-\frac{\,df_{2}}{f_{2}^{2}} =\frac{\omega}{f_{1}} +\frac{\omega'}{f_{2}}
          </me>
             For the combination to be achromatic, <m>-\frac{\,dF}{F^{2}}</m> must be equal to zero. Hence 
             <me>
              \frac{\omega}{f_{1}} +\frac{\omega'}{f_{2}} = 0

      <title> Rainbow:</title>
      <introduction>
        
      <p>
      A rainbow is an optical phenomenon, which is produced in the sky due to the combined effect 
      of refraction, internal reflection, and dispersion of light in water droplets. A rainbow 
      consists of the primary rainbow and the secondary rainbow. The primary (main) rainbow is 
      caused by two refractions and one internal reflection inside a rain droplet. The secondary 
      rainbow appears outside the primary one and is caused by two refractions and two internal 
      reflections inside the spherical water droplet. The colors of the secondary rainbow are reversed 
      from the primary bow, and the secondary bow is twice as broad.

        A rainbow can be seen in the sky when an observer facing opposite to the sun look at about 
        <m>42^o</m> above the horizon to suspended water droplets. Each individual droplet of water 
        acts as a tiny prism that both disperses the light and reflects it back to the observer's eye. 
        As you sight into the sky, wavelengths of light associated with a specific color arrive at 
        your eye from the collection of droplets as shown in <xref ref="rainbow"/>. The net effect 
        of the vast array of droplets is that a circular arc of <em>VIBGYOR</em> is seen across the sky. 
        A rainbow is actually a complete circle but observers on the ground only view the top half of 
        the circle since the bottom half of the circular arc is prevented by the presence of the ground. 
        However, observers in an airborne plane can view the complete circular bow. Rainbows are not 
        limited to the dispersion of light by raindrops. The splashing of water in front of you 
        forms water mist in the air and if you are facing opposite to the sun then the chances 
        are you can create your own rainbows. Bright sunlight, suspended water droplets and the 
        proper angle of sighting are the three necessary components for viewing one of nature's most 
        spectacular activities.

            That is, the different colors of light correspond to different wavelengths of light, 
            which are refracted at slightly different angles, thus splitting the white sunlight 
            into red and violet lights. The color of the primary rainbow are spread over about 
            <m>2^{o}</m> out of the <m>42^{o}</m> away from the anti-solar point as shown in <xref ref="rainbowc"/>. 
            The viewer sees the rainbow with the red at the outer side of the arc and the violet on 
            the inner side. Our perception of vision for violet light is not that sensitive 
            hence, we see blue light more clearly than violet light. It is to be remembered 
            that sunlight strikes the raindrops at different angles of incidence and undergoes 
            different deviations.  Only those rays produce a rainbow which have the angle of 
            incidence corresponding to maximum angles of deviation.

       It is a phenomenon of absorption and reemition of light energy in different directions when 
       it interacts with material particles. The intensity of scattered light depends on the size of 
       interacting particles, a and the wavelength of light,  
        </p>

          $\lambda$. If <m>a \lt \lt \lambda</m>, than the amount of light scattered is given by 
          <me>
            \sigma \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^{4}}.
          </me>
          When sunlight interacts with atmospheric particles, 
          blue colors scattered more in sky than any other colors from the visible spectrum of light, 
          hence, the sky looks bluish in color. In fact, violet light scattered more than blue but 
          our eyes are more sensitive to blue color than violet light hence blue colors are much 
          more prevailed than others in sky. At sunset and sunrise, the sunlight has to travel 
          longer distance in the atmosphere which causes most of the blue and other shorter wavelengths 
          are scattered in the sky and only red color is able to reach to our eyes hence, the 
          sun appears reddish in color. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The wavelength of constituent colors of white light is shown in <xref ref="colorsthinfilms"/> 
          If the size of interacting particle, <m>a \gt \gt \lambda</m>, then all the colors of light 
          scattered equally and no any specific color is dominant. This is the reason when sunlight 
          interacts with water droplets or clouds in sky they appear white rather than any other color.
