      The branch of Physics which deals with the property, propagation, and nature of sound is known as Acoustics. 
      Wave is a base to understand sound. Here we discuss the basics of wave first before we learn sound. 
      Now it is a good idea to know little bit about oscillatary motion before we start Wave. 
      Some discussions are provided in <url href="https://sklkarn.github.io/calPhysI/sec_seventh-oscil.html">Gneral Physics I</url> already.
      Here let us discuss <em>simple harmonic motion</em>.
