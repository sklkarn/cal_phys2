  <title>Electromagnetic Induction</title>
  
<introduction>
  <p>
    Orsted discovered that electric currents can 
   produce magnetic fields. Faraday discovered that magnetic fields can be used 
   to induce electric currents. It has been seen from experiments that whenever 
   there is a change in magnetic flux linked with the closed circuit, am emf (or current) 
   is induced in the circuit and lasts as long as this change happen. This phenomenon 
   is known as <term>electromagnetic induction</term>. 
   The magnetic flux through a circuit may be changed in the following ways: 
   <ol marker="i.">
    <li>
      by relative motion between a magnet and the circuit,
    </li>
    <li>
      by changing current in the same circuit,
    </li>
    <li>
      by changing current in the neighbouring circuit, and 
    </li>
    <li>
      by rotating a coil in a magnetic field.
    </li>
   </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Electromagnetic induction</term> is a process of producing an emf across the conductor 
    by making a relative motion between the conductor and magnetic field. In other word, 
    producing an emf across the conductor by placing a conductor in a changing magnetic 
    field or moving a conductor through a stationary magnetic field. This process causes 
    an electrical current in a conductor known as <term>induced current</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A moving electrical charge also generates a magnetic field just as changing magnetic 
    field induces current in a conductor. In fact, a traditional magnet is the result of 
    the individual motion of the electrons within the individual atoms of the magnet, 
    aligned so that the generated magnetic field is in a uniform direction as shown in 
    <xref ref="barmagloop"/>. (In non-magnetic materials, the electrons move in such a way that the 
    individual magnetic fields point in different directions, so they cancel each other 
    out and the net magnetic field generated is negligible.)
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Induced emf:</term> It is a voltage produced in a coil because of the changing magnetic 
    flux through a coil. An EMF can be induced in two ways, i.e., when an electric conductor is 
    kept in a moving magnetic field or when the electric conductor is constantly moving within a 
    static magnetic field.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-faraday">
  <title>Faraday's Law</title>
  <p>
    If the magnetic field changes, or if the magnet and coil are in relative motion, 
    there will be an induced emf (and therefore current) in the coil. The instantaneous 
    EMF (voltage) induced in a circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic 
    flux through the circuit. If <m>\Phi</m> is magnetic flux linked with the circuit at 
    any instant of time and <m>\varepsilon</m> is an induced emf, then 
    <me>
      \varepsilon \propto \frac{\,d\Phi}{\,dt}.
    </me>
    The direction of induced emf is such that it opposes the change in flux which produces it. Hence, 
    <me>
      \varepsilon = - \frac{\,d\Phi}{\,dt}.
    </me>
    The minus sign indicates the direction of the induced emf. If there are N number of 
    turns in current loops, then 
    <me>
      \varepsilon = - N \frac{\,d\Phi}{\,dt}.
    </me>
     When the magnetic flux inside a closed loop of wire (coil) changes, emf is induced in the wire, 
     <me>
      |emf| = \frac{\phi_{f}-\phi_{i}}{t_{f}-ti_{i}} 
     </me>
     <ol marker="i.">
      <li>
        The induced emf generates a current in the wire, <m>I=\frac{emf}{R}</m>
      </li>
      <li>
        The direction of the current is determined by the Lenz's law.
      </li>
     </ol>
  </p>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-lenz">
  <title>Lenz's Law</title>
  <p>
    An induced current always flows in a direction that opposes the change that caused it. 
    In other word, -ve sign in Faraday's law is Lenz's contribution. The changing magnetic 
    flux generates an emf according to Faraday, the polarity of this emf is such that it 
    induces the current in a circuit whose magnetic field opposes the change which produces it, according to Lenz.

    Suppose a bar magnet is moving towards a coil, then an emf is induced in the coil and 
    current starts flowing in a circuit (coil). The direction of this induced current will 
    be such that it opposes the motion of the magnet towards the coil. 
  </p>
  <p>
     The induced emf resulting from a changing magnetic flux has a polarity that leads to 
     an induced current whose direction is such that the induced magnetic field opposes the original flux change.
<ol>
  <li>
    When the magnetic flux is increasing, a magnetic field opposing to the increasing field is generated by induced current.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the magnetic flux is decreasing, a magnetic field in the same direction as the decreasing 
    field is generated by the induced current.
  </li>

    An emf will also be produced if a conductor moves through a magnetic field. 
    The emf comes from the motion of charges, which are free to move in the conductor. 
    If a rod is moving in a magnetic field positive charges collected at on edge 
    of the conductor and negative charge at the opposite edge.

    <title>Eddy Currents</title>
    <p>
      When a conductor is moved in a magnetic field, there is a force on the electrons, 
      which then move in the metal. This movement is called an eddy current. 
      The induced currents produce magnetic fields which tend to oppose the motion 
      of the metal. An eddy current is a swirling current set up in a conductor in 
      response to a changing magnetic field. According to Lenz's law the current 
      swirls in the conductor in such a way that it opposes the changing magnetic 
      field. To do so in a conductor, electrons swirl in a plane perpendicular 
      to the magnetic field. As the metal enters into the magnetic field, flux 
      starts increasing so to oppose this flux electrons of metal make loop in 
      such a way that the induced current has magnetic field opposing the increase. 
      As the metal plate begins leaving the magnetic field current loops on metal 
      surface just in opposite direction to the previous loops as shown in <xref ref="eddy"/>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of the tendency to oppose, eddy currents cause energy to be lost. 
      Due to eddy currents kinetic energy transforms into heat energy. One of the 
      practical applications of eddy currents is <term>magnetic braking</term>. 
      During braking, the metal wheels are exposed to a magnetic field from an 
      electromagnet, generating eddy currents in the wheels. The magnetic interaction 
      between the applied field and the eddy currents acts to slow the wheels down. 
      The faster the wheels are spinning, the stronger the effect, meaning that as 
      the train slows the braking force is reduced, producing a smooth stopping motion. 
    </p>
    <p>
      French physicist Leon Foucault in 1855 discovered eddy currents. 
      He found that the force needed to rotate a copper disk when its rim 
      is placed between the poles of a magnet, such as a horseshoe magnet, 
      increases and the disk is heated by the induced eddy currents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heating effect originates from the transformation of electric energy into 
      heat energy and is used in induction heating devices, like some cookers and welders. 
      The resistance felt by the eddy currents in a conductor causes Joule heating and 
      he amount of heat generated is proportional to the current squared. However, 
      for applications like motors, generators and transformers, this heat is considered 
      wasted energy and as such, eddy currents need to be minimized. This can be achieved by 
      laminating the metal cores of these devices, where each core is made up of multiple 
      insulated sheets of metal. This splits the core in many individual magnetic circuits 
      and restricts the flow of the eddy currents through it, reducing the amount of heat 
      generated through Joule heating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eddy currents can also be removed by cracks or slits in the conductor, 
      which break the circuit and prevent the current loops from circulating. 
      This means that eddy currents can be used to detect defects in materials. 
      This is called nondestructive testing and is often used in airplanes. 
      The magnetic field produced by the eddy currents is measured, where a 
      change in the field reveals the presence of an irregularity; a defect 
      will reduce the size of the eddy current, which in turn reduces the 
       magnetic field strength.

  <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-genertr">
    <title>Generator</title>
    <p>
      A generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. 
      As Faraday's law holds good for any shape of conductor moving in a magnetic field, 
      this principle can be used to design electric dynamo or generator where a 
      loop is rataing in a magnetic field.

      Consider a closed rectangular loop C of number of turns N, area of each loop 
      is A rotating in a uniform magnetic field B with angular velocity <m>\omega</m>. 
      As the loop rotates, the flux linked with the coil changes and an emf is induced 
      in the coil. Suppose at any instant the normal to plane of loop is making an angle 
      <m>\theta</m> with the magnetic field B, then magnetic flux linked with loop at that 
      time is given by 
      <me>
        \phi = N(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{A}) = NBA\cos\theta
      </me>
      <me>
        \therefore\quad \varepsilon =-N\frac{\,d\Phi}{\,dt} = -N\frac{\,d}{\,dt}(BA\cos\theta)
      </me>
      <me>
        = NBA\omega\sin\omega t  = \varepsilon_{o} \sin\omega t
      </me>
      <m>[\because \theta = \omega t]</m>
      where <m>\varepsilon_{o} = NBA \omega</m> =  maximum emf.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this loop is part of a circuit, this emf will induce an Alternating Current (AC) in the circuit. 
      If R is the resistance of the circuit, the induced current in the circuit is given by 
      <me>
        i=\frac{\varepsilon}{R}= \frac{NBA\omega}{R}\sin\omega t= i_{o}\sin\omega t
      </me>
      where <m>i_{o}</m> is the amplitude of the ac current.

  <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-skineffect">
    <title> Skin Effect</title>
    <p>
     When a steady current flows through a wire, it is distributed uniformly over 
     the entire cross-section of the wire. On the other hand, when an alternating 
     current flows through the a wire, it is concentrated mostly near the outer surface 
     of wire rather than the uniform distribution. This effect is called skin effect of 
     alternating current. The skin effect increases with increasing frequency. 
     In case of very high frequency current is almost wholly confined to the surface 
     layer of the wire. This is the reason in ac transmission current carrier wire 
     is made out of collection of many thin insulated stranded wires rather than one 
     thick single wire. Electromagnetic induction is the cause of skin effect.
