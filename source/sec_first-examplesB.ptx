          In the electrostatic case, charges do not move. Therefore, the charge carriers inside a

          Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, the flux through a Gaussian

          surface must be zero. If the Gaussian surface is constructed immediately below the surface 
          of the conductor, the charge inside the surface must still be zero. Since the charge on a 
          conductor cannot reside inside the surface of the conductor, it must reside on the surface.

          Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, the flux through a Gaussian

          of the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the inner surface of the conductor must contain a 
          charge equal and opposite to the charge surrounded by the conductor. Therefore, any remaining

      Consider a charged  q  at the geometric center of a cylinder of radius  R  and length  l. 
       An enclosed charge emits fluxes outward through all of its surfaces. To find the flux through

          If the electric field at the surface of a conductor has a component parallel to the surface, 
          the charges on the surface will move in that direction. Since they do not move in the electrostatic 
          situation, the electric field must be everywhere perpendicular to the surface of the conductor.

          Pick a Gaussian surface surrounding a small enough region of the conductor's surface so the charge 
          density is constant. Let <m>\,dq</m> be the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface and <m>\,dA</m> 
          the area of the surface of the conductor enclosed by the Gaussian surface. Then the charge per 
          unit area of the conductor in that region of space is <m>\sigma = \,dq/\,dA.</m>

        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Because <m>\sigma</m> is constant in this small region of space, due to symmetry the electric 
          field must be perpendicular to the surface of the conductor and constant at a distance d 
          from the surface. Consider a cylindrical Gaussian surface as shown in given figures. 
          Surfaces <m>S_{1}</m> and <m>S_{2}</m> are parallel to the conducting plane and surface 
          <m>S_{3}</m> is cylindrical surface  perpendicular to the conductor's surface and 
          parallel to electric field as shown in figure below.

          For a conductor electric field is only out side of the conductor but within it electric 
          field is zero as shown in figure at right. In charged conductors the excess charges have 
          distributed themselves optimally further away from one another so as to reduce the total 
          amount of repulsive forces. Once a charged conductor has reached the state of electrostatic 
          equilibrium, there is no further motion of charge about the surface as shown in figure below.
