  <title>Electric Field</title>
  
<introduction>
  <p>
    The space around a charge where force of attraction or repulsion can be experienced by any 
    other charged particle is called an <em>electric field</em> of the charge. 
    Electric field is also known as electrostatic field intensity.

    It is an inherent property of a charge. An electric field is produced by one charge 
    and is experienced by another one. It is an electric field of a charge which tells 
    another charge how to move in the space if it is free to do so.  Electric field is 
    defined as a <em>force per unit charge</em> and is a vector quantity. It is directed 
    along the direction of force on a unit positive charge, i.e., electric field of a point charge 
    <me>
      \vec{E}  =  \frac{\vec{F}}{q}
    </me>
    or, 
    <me>
      \vec{E}  =k\frac{q}{r^{2}}\hat{r}  
    </me>
     where <m>\hat{r}</m> is a direction of electric field which is along the line joining the two charges.

      <term>Electric Field Lines:</term>
    It is an imaginary path along which a unit positive test charge can move in any electric field 
    if it is free to do so. It is always in the direction of  electric field vectors leaving from 
    positive charges and ending on negative charges. Density of lines indicates field strength. 
    Electric lines of force diverge from positive charge and converge in a negative charge as shown in <xref ref="fig6"/>.

    <term>Test Charge:</term> It is an imaginary unit positive charge that can not distort the electric 
    field of any other charge. It is used to determine the direction of electric field vector. 
    Its magnitude is 1 C and is denoted by <m>q_{o}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <alert>Electric Dipole:</alert> <idx><h>dipole</h></idx>
It is a small displacement between two equal and opposite charges. It acquires rotational effect if 
exposed in an external field and hence it is also known as electric dipole moment, i.e., 
<me>
  \vec{p}  =  q d (\hat{u}), 
</me>
where d  is a distance between two equal charges and <m>\hat{u}</m> is unit vector along the line 
joining from -ve charge to +ve charge. Dipole moment is a vector quantity whose direction 
is pointed along negative to positive charge. When a dipole is placed in an external electric 
field it shows a rotating effect. Torque on a dipole in an electric field is given as 
<m>\vec{\tau}  = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}</m> and potential energy of dipole in an electric 
field	is given as <me>
  U  =  â€“ \vec{p}\cdot \vec{E}.
</me>
<me>
  \vec{\tau} = \vec{d} \times \vec{F}
</me>
<me>
  =d F \sin\theta\hat{n}=\left(r q E\sin\theta+r q E\sin\theta \right)\hat{n} 
</me>
<me>
  = q (2r) E\sin\theta \hat{n}= qd\hat{r} \times \vec{E} = \vec{ p} \times \vec{E} 
</me>
<me>
  \text{and}\quad \left[U=\vec{F}\cdot\vec{d} = q\vec{E}\cdot\vec{d} =q\vec{d}\cdot\vec{E}  = \vec{p}\cdot\vec{E} \right] 
</me>

 <term> Electric field inside the conductor:</term> 
 When a cube is placed in a uniform electric field, <m>\vec{E}</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fieldinside"/> 
 then flux (electric lines of force normal to the surface) coming into the cube is equal to 
 the flux going out of the cube through top and bottom faces, while there is no flux through 
 any other faces as field is perpendicular to these faces. Hence total flux, <m>\phi =0 </m> 
 through a closed cube. If a conducting plate is placed in an external field  then it induces the 
 charge on its surface or even a dielectric inside a field polarizes charges as shown in <xref ref="fieldinsideb"/> 
 which ultimately reduces the effective electric field. The field inside the dielectrics is 
 called polarized field which is opposite to the external field. Hence the resultant (effective) 
 field is 
 <me>
  \vec{E_{r}}= \vec{E}-\vec{E'}
 </me>

<p>
 In case of a conductor separation of charges makes total electric field zero inside it because 
 of its sufficient free charges neutralize the external electric field. In case of dielectrics 
 separation of charges inside it reduces the field because of its bonded electrons can only nullify 
 the external field to a limited extent. For a conductor electric field is only out side of 
 the conductor but within it electric field is zero. In charged conductors the excess charges 
 have distributed themselves optimally further away from one another so as to reduce the total 
 amount of repulsive forces. Once a charged conductor has reached the state of electrostatic 
 equilibrium, there is no further motion of charge about the surface (<xref ref="fieldinsidec"/>) and hence no 
 electric field inside the conductor. If hole is made on a charged conductor still there is 
 no field inside the hole or within the conductor (<xref ref="fieldinsided"/>). If a charge Q is placed inside 
 the hole of a charged (or uncharged) conductor it induces opposite charges at the inner surface 
 and similar charges on the outer surface of the conductor but field within the conductor still 
 remains zero (<xref ref="fieldinsidee"/>).
