  <title>Waves in a Medium</title>
  
<introduction>
  <p>
    When wave propagates in a medium it deforms the shape of a medium and hence to understand wave 
    motion completely in a medium the following terminologies will be helpful. 
     </p>
     <p>
      <term>Mass per Unit Length, <m>\mu</m>:</term> It is the mass of a wire in its unit length i.e., 
      <me>
        \mu= \frac{m}{L},
      </me>
      where m is mass of the wire of length, L. Its unit is kg/m.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Bulk Modulus, <m>B</m>:</term> It is the ratio of volumetric stress to the volumetric strain i.e., 
      [Read <url href="https://sklkarn.github.io/calPhysI/ch_eighth.html">Elasticity</url> for details.]
      <me>
        B=\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta V/V}. 
      </me>
     It defines the incompressibility of the material. It describes the elastic properties of a 
     solid or fluid when it is under pressure on all surfaces. Its unit is Pascal (Pa).
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Young's Modulus, <m>Y</m>:</term> It is the ratio of longitudinal stress to the longitudinal strain, i.e., 
      <me>
        Y=\frac{F/A}{\Delta L/L},
      </me>
      where F is applied force normal to the cross-section of a wire, A is cross-sectional area of a wire, 
      L is length of the wire, and <m>\Delta L</m> is change in length of the wire after the application 
      of this force. It describes the ability of a material to deform its length under the lengthwise stress. 
      Its unit is Pascal (Pa).
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Ratio of Specific Heat Capacities, <m>\gamma</m>:</term> The specific heat capacity is a material 
      property which defines heat absorbing capacity of a unit mass of material for unit rise of temperature. 
      From first law of thermodynamics, 
      <me>
        \,dQ=\,dU+P\,dV
      </me>
       when heat is supplied to the gas at constant volume it increases its internal energy but 
       by doing so  pressure of the gas also increases. When gas is heated at constant pressure 
       it not only increases its internal energy but it also expands hence the system (gas) has 
       to do extra work on the surrounding. The energy needed for expansion is taken from the 
       internal energy of the gas. To compensate such work and have the same increase in internal 
       energy as at constant volume some additional heat must be absorbed by the system at constant 
       pressure. Hence the gas has two specific heat capacities, called specific heat at constant 
       volume, <m>c_{v}</m> and specific heat at constant pressure, <m>c_{p}.</m> The ratio of 
       these two heat capacities is defined as <m>\gamma</m> i.e., 
       <me>
        \gamma = \frac{c_{p}}{c_{v}}.
       </me>
       On the other hand, Solid and liquid are considered as an incompressible material hence their 
       specific heat capacities at constant volume and pressure have almost the same value hence 
       they have only one specific heat capacity. 
       [read <url href="https://sklkarn.github.io/calPhysI/subsec-Ilaw_appl.html"><m>\gamma</m></url>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Ideal Gas:</term> A hypothetical gas whose molecules are negligibly small and have no 
      interaction between them is called an ideal gas or perfect gas. Small amount of gas molecules 
      in a very large container may be considered as an ideal gas if it obeys the laws of ideal gas. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Pressure, P:</term> Force per unit area on the surface of any material is known as pressure. 
      It is generally considered as a scalar quantity. Its unit is Pascal (pa).
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Gas Constant, R:</term> It is a universal constant that appears in an ideal gas equation 
      <me>
        PV=nRT
      </me>
      where <m>n</m> stands for number of mole of a gas. The value of R is approximately  <m>8.3145 \, J/K/mol</m>. 
      It is equivalent to Boltzmann constant, k as 
      <me>
        PV=NkT
      </me>
       where <m>N</m> stands for number of molecules in a gas and  <m>N_{A}k = R</m> since 
       <m>N=N_{A}=6.022\times10^{23}\, /mol</m>, Avagadro's number for n = 1 mole. 
       The value of k is approximately <m>1.3806\times10^{-23} \,J/K</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Molecular Mass:</term> The mass of one molecule of any substance is known as a 
      molecular mass. It is a number equal to the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a 
      molecule. It provides the mass of a molecule relative to that of the mass of C-12 atom.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Molar Mass,M:</term> The mass of one mole of any substance is known as a molar mass. 
      Its unit is g/mol. The molar mass of C-12 substance is 12 g/mol.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Atomic Mass Unit, amu or u:</term> 1 amu is <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> of the mass of C-12 atom. 
      Mass of one atom of C-12 is 12 amu as it contains 12 (6 proton + 6 neutrons) elementary particles. 
      Since <m>6.022\times10^{23}</m> atoms of C-12 has mass of 12 g, hence 
      <me>1 \,amu = \left(\frac{1}{12}\right) \, (\text{mass of one atom of C-12})</me> 
      <me>
       = \left(\frac{1}{12}\right)\left(\frac{12\,g/mol}{6.022\times10^{23}\,1/mol}\right) = 1.66\times10^{-24} \,g = 1\,u.
      </me>
     It is the mass of one proton or one hydrogen atom.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Absolute Temperature, T:</term> The value of temperature measured in Kelvin scale, 
      a hypothetical temperature scale, is known as absolute temperature. It is also known as 
      thermodynamic temperature. The lowest possible value of absolute temperature is absolute 
      zero and from third law of thermodynamics, absolute zero is physical unattainable by any means. 
      Temperature is an average kinetic energy per molecule of a substance and at absolute zero 
      the molecular motion is ceased i.e. no heat remains in a molecule at absolute zero. 
      The value of each division of kelvin scale is same as that in centigrade scale i.e., 
      change in temperature in absolute scale is numerically equal to change in temperature in 
      centigrade scale. Absolute zero is equal to  <m>-270.15\,^{o}C.</m>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-speed_TW">
  <title>Speed of a Transverse Wave</title>
  <p>
    Let us consider an elastic string tightly stretched between its two ends by a constant tension T. 
    The string is caused to vibrate by plucking it with a very small displacement so that the tension T 
    remains constant through out the deflections of the string. Consider a small element of the string 
    of arc length <m>\,ds</m> [<xref ref="speedTW"/>] which is moving at a constant velocity, v towards right.  
    If this arc subtends an angle <m>2\theta</m> at its center then length of arc, <m>\,ds=R (2\theta)</m> 
    where R is radius of the arc. If <m> \mu </m> is mass per unit length of a string then 
    mass of the arc, 
    <me>
      m =  \mu R 2\theta.
    </me>
    The force acting on the string element along x-axis is given by 
    <me>
      F_{x}= T\cos\theta-T\cos\theta=0, 
    </me>
    i.e., there is no horizontal motion of the particle of a string.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="speedTW">

    <image source="speedTW.png" width="50%"/>
</figure>
  <p>
    The force acting on the string element along y-axis is given by 
    <me>
      F_{y}= T\sin\theta+T\sin\theta=2 T\sin\theta = ma
    </me>
    i.e.,  because of the circular portion of string each particle of string element experiences centripetal force. 
    <me>
      \text{Hence,}\quad 2 T\sin\theta = m\frac{v^{2}}{R}
    </me>
    where v is a velocity of wave which is passing through the string. 
    <me>
      \text{Now,}\quad 2 T \theta = \mu R 2\theta \frac{v^{2}}{R}
    </me>
    <me>
      \text{or,}\quad v= \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
    </me>
    Hence the velocity of wave depends on the tension and mass per unit length of a string. 
    Velocity of mechanical waves generally takes the form 
    <me>
      v=\frac{\text{Restoring ability of a system}}{\text{Inertia resisting the return to equilibrium}}

  <title>Speed of a Longitudinal Wave</title>
  <p>
    When a longitudinal wave passes through a fluid, it produces a local compression 
    and rarefaction (expansion of the fluid). Consider a column of fluid of cross-sectional 
    area A in which a longitudinal wave is being passed perpendicularly to the cross-section [<xref ref="LW"/>]. 
    As the wave passes a small portion of fluid of volume <m>V_{i}</m> having thickness 
    <m>\,dx=x_{2}-x_{1}</m> will move and gets compressed because of the pressure difference 
    between both faces.

  The right face experiences a backward pressure of <m>P+\,dP</m> and the left face experience 
  a forward pressure of <m>P</m>. Hence due to the forces difference fluid move to 
  the right and as it accelerates it will change its volume to <m>V_{f}.</m> 
The fluid column only experiences normal force along x-axis as it does not support shear forces. 
If 
<me>
  s(x,t) =\frac{s_{1}+s_{2}}{2}
</me>
 is the displacement of fluid column from <m>x_1</m> to <m>x_1+s_1</m>, 
 then from Newton's law

  But from Bulk modulus of elasticity, 
  <me>
    B=-\frac{P}{\,dV/V_{i}}
  </me>
  <me>
    \text{or,}\quad P = -B\left(\frac{\,dV}{V_{i}}\right)

  <me>
    \therefore \quad P = -B\frac{A\,ds}{A\,dx}=-B\frac{\,ds}{\,dx}

  <men xml:id="eqn-speedLW2">
    \text{or,} \quad \frac{\,dP}{\,dx} = -B\frac{\,d^{2}s}{\,dx^{2}}

    -\rho \frac{\,d^{2}s}{\,dt^{2}}=-B\frac{\,d^{2}s}{\,dx^{2}}

  <men xml:id="eqn-speedLW3">
    \therefore \quad  \frac{\,d^{2}s}{\,dx^{2}}=\frac{\rho}{B}\frac{\,d^{2}s}{\,dt^{2}}

  Which is the wave equation of longitudinal wave. Hence 
  <men xml:id="eqn-speedLW4">
    s(x,t) = s_{o}\sin(kx-\omega t) 
  </men>
  where <m> s_{o} </m> is the amplitude of the wave or maximum displacement of fluid column,

      p(x,t) = -Bks_{o}\cos(kx-\omega t)  
    </men>
    which is lagging behind the displacement <m>s(x,t)</m> by quarter of wavelength 
    and  
    <me>
      p_{max} = B\,k\,s_{o}

     <me>
      \text{Hence,}\quad -s_{o}k^{2}\sin(kx-\omega t) =-\frac{\rho}{B} s_{o}\omega^{2}\sin(kx-\omega t)

     <me>
      \text{or,}\quad k^{2} =\frac{\rho}{B}\omega^{2}

     <me>
      \text{or,}\quad \frac{1}{\lambda^{2} f^{2}}=\frac{\rho}{B}
     </me>
     <me>
      \therefore \quad v^{2}=\frac{B}{\rho}
     </me>
     Hence the speed of longitudinal wave in fluid is given by 
     <me>
      v=\sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}
     </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        In general speed of longitudinal wave is 
        <me>
          v=\sqrt{\frac{\text{elastic property}}{\text{inertial property}}}
        </me>
        This is the same as writing 
         <me>
          v = \sqrt{\frac{Y}{\rho}}	\quad	\text{(in solid)}
        </me>
       Newton assumed that the process is very slow when a wave passes through fluid 
       hence the temperature remains constant through out the process,  i.e., 
       <me>
        PV  =constant
       </me>
       <me>
        \text{or,} \quad P\,dV+V\,dP =0
       </me>
       <me>
        \text{or,}\quad P\,dV=-V\,dP
       </me>
       <me>
        \text{or,}\quad P = -\frac{\,dP}{\,dV/V} = B
       </me>
       <me>
        \therefore\quad v = \sqrt{\frac{P}{\rho}}
       </me>
     Now at normal temperature and pressure (NTP) the atmospheric pressure is 
     <m>
      P=1.01\times10^{5} \,N/m^{2}
     </m>
     and density of air is <m>\rho=1.293 \,kg/m^{3}</m>, we have velocity of sound in air is 
     <me>
      v = \sqrt{\frac{P}{\rho}}=280\, m/s
     </me>
     But the experimental value of sound in air is 332 m/s. 
     Hence Laplace modified this solution by assuming that when wave flows through the fluid 
     compression and rarefaction occur so fast that there is no exchange of heat between the 
     system and surrounding in fluid.  Hence 
     <me>
      PV^{\gamma} = constant
     </me>
     <me>
      \text{or,} \quad V^{\gamma}\,dP + P\gamma V^{\gamma-1}\,dV =0 
     </me>
     <me>
      \text{or,} \quad V^{\gamma}\,dP =- P\gamma V^{\gamma-1}\,dV
     </me>
     <me>
      \text{or,} \quad \,dP =- P \gamma V^{-1}\,dV
     </me>
     <me>
      \text{or,} \quad -\frac{\,dP}{\,dV/V} = P \gamma = B
     </me>
     <me>
      \therefore \quad v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho}}=332 \,m/s \quad [\gamma=1.4] 
     </me>
     <me>
      \text{Also,} \quad v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}\quad \text{(In Ideal Gas)} 
     </me>
     <me>\left[\because\quad PV = nRT = \frac{m}{M}RT]  \quad  \text{or,} \quad P = \frac{RT}{\rho \,M}\right]. </me>

    When wave passes through the medium it transfers energy to that medium.

    Waves on a string carry energy along the length of the string, but when waves pass 
    through a solid or a fluid they carry energy along all three dimensions of space. 
    Hence we need to define intensity of wave, which is energy transmitted by the wave 
    in unit area of this material in unit time. 
    <me>
      I = \frac{E}{A t} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}_{max}} {A t} =\frac{\frac{1}{2}\rho V (s_{o}\omega)^{2}} {A t}

  <title>Interference of Mechanical Waves</title>
  <p>
    When a wave travels to the end of a medium all or part of it is reflected back. 
    The nature of the reflected wave depends upon the state of boundary known as <em>boundary conditions</em>. 
    Consider a wave (e.g. a pulse) on a stretched string approaches the fixed end to the right it 
    exerts a force on a fixed support and according to Newton's third law a fixed support also 
    exerts a force on the string, as a result an inverted pulse (wave) travels back to the left 
    and when these two incident and reflected waves overlap they cancels each other as shown 
    in <xref ref="fixep"/>.

      On the other hand, when a wave pulse travels along a string with a free 
      end (one end of string attached to a ring that is free to slide along a pole) and when the wave 
      reaches to the free end at its maximum displacement both wave and string come to at rest for a moment. 
      During this time string is stretched to highest value and applies a maximum tension on string due 
      to which string gets pulled back down which constitutes a reflected wave pulse but in the same phase 
      as incident wave pulse. When they overlap the amplitude of pulse increased by double as shown 
      in <xref ref="freep"/>. The total displacement of overlapping wave pulses is an algebraic sum 
      of their displacement in individual pulses.

  <idx> principle of superposition</idx>
When two wave pulses traveling along a rope in opposite direction they pass through each other 
undisturbed and continue moving with their individual original amplitude and velocity. 
They interact only at a point of overlap where their amplitude become algebraic sum of their 
individual amplitudes as shown in <xref ref="spmw"/>.

  When two or more waves superimpose (overlap) at a point then the resultant displacement of 
  the medium particle is the algebraic sum of the displacement of the particle due to 
  individual waves. This is known as <term>principle of superposition</term>. Let 
  <m>y_{1}(x,t)</m> and <m>y_{2}(x,t)</m> are the wave functions of two waves, then from priciple 
  of superposition the resulting displacement of a particle at that point is given by the wave function 
  <me>
    y(x,t) = y_{1}(x,t)+y_{2}(x,t)
  </me>
  Wave function has a linear property (meaning wave function depends only the first power of x 
  and t but not on their higher power) hence the principle of superposition holds good only 
  in a medium which obeys Hooke's Law. Superposition of two or more waves gives rise to 
  interference. When two similar waves superimpose in the same phase their amplitude re-enforce 
  each other and resultant amplitude is just the double of their individual amplitude such 
  interference is called a <em>constructive interference</em>. For constructive interference 
  the path difference between two superimposing waves is given by 
  <me>
    \Delta x = n \lambda, \quad n = 0, 1, 2,\cdots
  </me>
  When two similar waves superimpose in the opposite phase their amplitude cancels out 
  each other and resultant amplitude is just zero such interference is called a <em>destructive interference</em>. 
  For destructive interference the path difference between two superimposing waves is given by 
  <me>
    \Delta x = \frac{n}{2} \lambda, \quad n = 1, 3, 5,\cdots
  </me>
  The path difference of two waves is related to their phase difference by 
  <me>
    \Delta \theta = 2\pi \left(\frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}\right)

  <title> Traveling Waves (or Progressive Waves):</title>
  <p>
  <idx>progressive waves</idx>
A wave which can propagate in a medium  and carry energy from one location to another is 
known as progressive or traveling wave. As progressive wave  passes through a medium 
each particle executes same type of vibration as the preceding one. No particle is 
permanently at rest except at its extreme position. All the particles of the medium 
attain same maximum velocity as they cross their mean position.  A progressive wave 
is represented by 
<me>
  \frac{\,d^{2}y}{\,dx^{2}} = \frac{1}{v^{2}}\frac{\,d^{2}y}{\,dt^{2}}
</me>
where v is the velocity of the wave. The wave function is given by 
<me>
  y(x,t)=A\sin(kx-\omega t)
</me>

where <m>\omega=2\pi\nu</m> is the angular frequency and <m>k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}</m> is the wave number.

  <title> Standing Waves (or stationary waves):</title>
  <introduction>
     <p>
 <idx>stationary waves</idx> 
 A wave which appears stand still and does not seem to be moving is called a standing wave. 
 It is a pattern of waves rather than wave itself. When two (or more) progressive waves 
 of same frequency travel in a same medium in opposite directions overlap in such a way that 
  the position of medium particles seem stand still at the same point is know as a standing wave. 
  It is a superposition of progressive wave with its own reflection. There is no onward motion 
  of the disturbance as no particle transfers its motion to the next. Since the waves seem 
  stand still the position of medium particles form a pattern of nodes and antinodes. 
  The point in a medium where amplitude of oscillation is zero is called <term>nodes</term>. 
  The point in a medium where oscillations reach to their maximum value is called  <term>antinodes</term>.  
  All points on the string oscillate at the same frequency but with different amplitudes. 
  Standing wave is one of the normal modes of vibrations of stretched string.

    The wave function of standing wave can be found as 
    <me>
      y_{1}(x,t)=A\sin (kx-\omega t)\quad [\text{wave travels along +x axis.}]
    </me>
    <me>
      y_{2}(x,t)=A\sin (kx+\omega t)\quad [\text{wave travels along -x axis.}]
    </me>
    From the principle of superposition the resultant wave is 
    <me>
      y(x,t)=y_{1}(x,t)+y_{2}(x,t)
    </me>
    <me>
      = A\left[\sin (kx-\omega t)+\sin (kx+\omega t)\right]

</me>
<men xml:id="eqn-standw1">
  \therefore\quad y(x,t) = 2A\sin kx\cos\omega t
</men>

The term  <m>\sin kx </m> describes the sinusoidal shape of the wave pattern and the term 
<m>\cos\omega t</m> describes the flip-flop (up-down oscillatory)  motion of each wave segment. 
This  is no longer a progressive wave equation as position and time dependence of the wave equation 
have been separated from each other. The term <m>2A \,\sin kx </m> defines the amplitude of a 
wave at a given location and the term <m>\cos\omega t</m> defines the variation in displacement 
of a medium particle with time, t.
