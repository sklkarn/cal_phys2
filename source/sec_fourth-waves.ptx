  <title>Waves</title>
  
<introduction>
  <p>
    When a stone is thrown in a quiet pond a number of nice circular rings, called <em>ripples</em> 
    [<xref ref="ripples"/>] emerge on the surface of the water which grow gently and move across the pond in a concentric pattern. 
    These growing ripples are called a <term>wave</term> which carries energy from the point of stone 
    thrown to the edge of a pond. Hence a wave can be defined as a disturbance in space that can 
    carry energy from one location to another. A wave creates in a medium when a medium is trying 
    to regain its equilibrium state. When a stone is thrown it transfers its energy to the surface 
    of water due to which water layer stretches downwards till stone dips down that layer of water. 
    When stone leaves the water layer, water layer wants to recover its original position to maintain 
    equilibrium due to surface tension but as it reaches to the original position it keeps raising 
    upward because of inertia and stretches the water surface again till reaches the maximum height. 
    Now due to surface tension this layer of water gets pulled down again and starts sinking down 
    below the equilibrium position due to inertia such procedure is the cause of waves on water.

        Energy propagates two ways in water one way is due to vertical up and down motion of water 
    surface and another way is a back and forth motion of water molecules inside the water. 
    Similar to concentric circles on water surface energy transmitted in space in the form of 
    concentric spheres. <xref ref="ripples2"/> shows the same disturbances traveling away from the center 
    as a series of successive <em>wavefronts</em> labeled crests and troughs. A wavefront is a locus of 
    points along which all phases and displacements are identical. The solid circles depict the 
    outward-moving wave crests; the dashed circles represent wave troughs. Adjacent crests are always 
    a wavelength apart, as are the adjacent troughs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On the basis of particle motion relative to the direction of energy propagation there are two forms of waves 
        <ol>
          <li>
            Longitudinal wave, and 
          </li>
          <li>
            Transverse wave.
          </li>
        </ol>
        In longitudinal wave the medium particles vibrate parallel to the direction of the energy propagation. 
        Longitudinal waves are also called <em>pressure waves</em>. As a layer of one part of a medium creates 
        pressure on the other part of the medium. Sound waves in any medium, waves propagating along spring 
        are some examples of such wave. In transverse wave the medium particles vibrate perpendicular to 
        the direction of the energy propagation. Movement of a wave through a solid object like a stretched 
        rope or a trampoline is some examples of such wave.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the basis of requirement of medium to propagate energy there are two types of waves. 
        <ol>
          <li>
            Mechanical wave, and 
          </li>
          <li>
            Electromagnetic wave.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Mechanical waves require material medium to propagate such as sound waves, water waves, string waves, 
        seismic waves, etc. Electromagnetic waves, on the other hand do not require any medium but can propagate 
        both in vacuum and in a medium, such as light waves, heat waves, radio waves, etc. Electromagnetic (em) 
        waves  are transverse in nature where electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other 
        and are also perpendicular to the direction of energy propagatation.

        Longitudinal waves occur when a spring is fixed at one end and pulled back and forth by the other 
        end as shown in <xref ref="long2"/>. Transverse waves occur when a spring or string is fixed at 
        one end and wiggled up and down by the other end  as shown in <xref ref="gr21"/>. Both the waves 
        can be easily described by a transverse nature as they are periodic in nature as shown in <xref ref="gr20"/>. 
        The <term>crest</term> is the highest point on a wave. The <term>trough</term> is the valley 
        between two waves. It is the lowest point. The <term>wavelength,</term> <m>\lambda</m> is the 
        distance, either between the crests or troughs of two consecutive waves. It is the length of 
        one complete wave. The <term>amplitude</term>, A is the peak value (either positive or negative) 
        of a wave. The distance from the undisturbed level (equilibrium position) to the trough or crest. 
        The <em>compression</em> is the part of the longitudinal wave where the particles crowded together. 
        The <em>rarefaction</em> is the part of the longitudinal wave where the particles spread out. 
        The <em>wavelength</em> is the distance from compression to compression or rarefaction to rarefaction in 
        a pressure (longitudinal) wave. The <term>frequency</term>, <m>\nu</m> is a number of complete waves 
        per second. If T is a time period to generate one complete wave then 
        <me>
          \nu=\frac{1}{T}.
        </me>
        Its unit is Hertz (<m>H_{z}</m>), i.e. cycles per second.
        <fn>There is a third kind of new wave which has just been discovered, known as a <term>gravitaional wave</term>. 
          It is a disturbance in spacetime and can pass through anything undisturbed. It travels with the 
          velocity of light. It stretches and squashes the spacetime during propagation. <term>Strain:</term> 
          The ratio of y displacement (stretch) to the x-displacement (squash) of medium is called a strain.
          <m>strain=\frac{\,dy}{\,dx}</m>  </fn>

        <term>Pulse and Periodic Waves:</term> A single vibratory disturbance that moves from point to point 
        is called a pulse. A single wiggle flowing in a straight line is a pulse wave as shown in <xref ref="gr23"/>. 
        When the pulse reaches a boundary with another medium, a part of it is reflected and a part is transmitted 
        through the boundary. When a pulse reaches a fixed boundary (dead end), then the pulse is completely 
        reflected and inverted by <m>180^{o}</m> out of phase. The series of evenly timed disturbances in 
        a medium is called a <em>periodic wave</em>. It repeats the same pattern over and over again after 
        a fixed interval of time as shown in <xref ref="gr22"/>. The source of a pulse wave is non periodic disturbance. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Sinusoidal Waves:</term> The waves which take the form of sine or cosine function is known as 
        sinusoidal waves. It is a single frequency periodic wave and is a consequence of simple harmonic motion 
        of a medium particles. In fact, any periodic wave can be represented as a combination of sinusoidal waves. 
        Instead of sinusoidal wave there are other forms of waves which are very important in electronics, 
        they are square wave, sawtooth wave, etc.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Wave Number, <m>\kappa</m>:</term> The number of complete waves per unit length is called a wave number. 
        It is also sometimes called a propagation constant. If <m>\lambda</m> is a wavelength of a wave then 
        <me>
          \kappa = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}.
        </me>
        Its unit is <m>m^{-1}</m>  or <m>rad/m^{-1}.</m> 
      </p>
      <p>
       <term> Wave Velocity (Phase Velocity):</term> The velocity at which phase of a wave can travel 
       is called a phase velocity. It is the velocity with which a crest or trough of a wave can progress in space. 
       <me>
        v =\frac{\,dx}{\,dt}
       </me>
       <me>

       </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <term>Particle Velocity:</term> It is the velocity of a medium particle which oscillates about 
          its mean position when a wave passes through the medium. 
          <me>
            v_{y} = \frac{\,dy}{\,dt}.

          </figure>
            <p>
              <term>Group Velocity:</term> The velocity at which energy is transported is called a group velocity. 
              In reality, any signal consists of packets of waves of different frequencies, which travel together. 
              The speed of the wave packets is called the group velocity. The group velocity [<xref ref="beats"/>] is a bit slower 
              than the phase velocity of the individual waves. The packet moves slower than the single-frequency wave. 
              If the medium is  dispersionless then the group and phase velocity are the same.

      The equation 
      <me>
        y=A\sin\omega t
      </me>
       represents the displacement of a single particle constituting SHM. Now if a wave of velocity v is 
       propagating in a medium then the medium particles oscillates about its mean position. 
       Consider a particle, P at a distance, x from position, A then wave reaches to P at time 
       <me>
        t_{1}=\frac{x}{v}
       </me>
       and the displacement of particle, P at time  <m>t_{1}</m> would be the same as the displacement 
       of particle, O at <m>t-t_{1}</m> [<xref ref="rfcc"/>]. Thus the displacement of particle, P in a medium at any instant 
       <m>t_{1}</m> is given by

            = A \sin\omega \left(t-\frac{x}{v}\right) = A \sin \left(\omega t-2\pi f\frac{x}{v}\right)

           <me>
            = A \sin \left(\omega t-2\pi \frac{x}{\lambda}\right)
           </me>
           Or, in general the wave function can be written as
           <me>
            y= A \sin (\omega t-kx)
           </me>
          where <me>\omega = 2\pi f =  \frac{2\pi}{T},</me>  and <me>k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}.</me> 
          This is the same as writing 
         <men xml:id="eqn-weq1">
          y(x,t)=A \sin (kx-\omega t).
         </men>    
         </p>
    <p>
      We can also express the wave function as 
      <men xml:id="eqn-weq2">
        y(x,t)=A \sin (kx\pm\omega t)
      </men>
      
      where <em>+ve</em> sign for wave progressing in -ve direction 
      and <em>-ve</em> for wave progressing in +ve direction. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sinusoidal wave function can also be represented as 
      <me>
        y(x,t) = A \cos(\omega t-kx) 
      </me>
      <me>
        \text{or,} \quad y(x,t) = A \cos(kx-\omega t) 
      </me>
      or in more general case the combination of both or in a complex form like these 
     <men xml:id="eqn-weq3">
      y(x,t) = A \sin(kx-\omega t)+B \cos(kx-\omega t) = Ae^{i(kx-\omega t)}
     </men>
     
      Any of above wave functions describe the same wave. If time is counted from the maximum displacement 
      of the medium particle's initial position then cosine term appears, if time is counted 
      from the minimum displacement of the medium particle as an initial position or its maximum 
      velocity then sine term appears in the derivation of wave function.
