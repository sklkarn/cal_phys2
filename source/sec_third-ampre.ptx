  <introduction>
    <p>
      Ampere's Law states that the line integral of the tangential component of a 
      magnetic field B around a closed path is proportional to the current enclosed 
      <m>I_{enc}</m>  by the loop. i.e.,
      <me>

    <proof>
      <p>
        The magnetic field at a point P on the circular path due to current carrying wire is given by 
        <me>
          B=\frac{\mu_{o}I}{2\pi r}
        </me>
        Magnetic field is parallel to the tangential direction at any point on circular path. 
        Hence line integral of the field around the circular path centered on the current 
        carrying wire is given by 
        <me>
          \oint\vec{B}\cdot\vec{\,dl} = \oint B\,dl\cos\theta = \oint B \,dl
        </me>
        <me>
          =\oint \frac{\mu_{o}I}{2\pi r} (r\,d\theta)= \frac{\mu_{o}I}{2\pi} (2\pi)=\mu_{o}I
        </me>
         </p>
         <p>
          Thus we have -
         <me>
          \oint\vec{B}\cdot\vec{dl} = \mu_{o} I_{enc}
         </me>
          The sign of integral is +ve if path follwed for line integral is parallel to B 
          and -ve if the path followed is anti-parallel. Ampere's law holds for closed path of any shape.
         </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Ampere's law is an anlogous to Gauss's law in electrostatics and is useful to determine 
      magnetic field when the current distribution is symmetrical. Amperean equation always 
      holds good whether the current distribution is symmetrical or not but we can only use 
      the equation to determine B when symmetrical current distribution exists. Ampere's law 
      is a special case of Biot-Savart's law. In order to apply Ampere's Law.

          Currents have to be taken with their algebraic signs using right hand's 
          rule to determine directions and signs (currents going <em>out</em> of 
          the surface are positive and those going <em>in</em> are negative).

   The direction of magnetic field can be dtermined by right hand thumb rule and the 
   magnetic field is inversely proportional to the distance of the point from the current carrying conductor [<xref ref="gr7"/>].
  </p>
  <p>
    The magnetic field at point P' inside the conductor [<xref ref="amper2a"/>] can be determined by 
    considering a finite thickness of current carrying rod of radius a and  
    the point P' is at distance  b  from the axis of conductor then current 
    enclosed by the Amperean loop passing through P' is <m>I' \lt I.</m> 
    If <m>J=\frac{I}{\pi r^{2}}</m> is a current density then,

    Consider a flat sheet of negligible thickness which carries current I along y-axis [<xref ref="flatsheet"/>]. 
    Now to find the magnetic field at any point consider an amperean loop passing

      Here B varies along z-axis, so  <m>B_{x}</m> is replaced with <m>B_{z}</m>

      below bottom surface of the sheet.

      Note that the field is completely uniform above the sheet, and 
      likewise uniform below the sheet, but across the sheet there is discontinuity.

    Consider a solenoid [<xref ref="solenoid"/>] of number of turns per unit length is n. Now consider an

    Now magnetic field <m>B_{out}</m> at any point outside of the solenoid 
    is zero because field due to current <m>I_{in}</m> cancels out the field due

    Toroid is considered as an infinitely long solenoid or an endless solenoid as shown

    inside the toroid consider an Amperean loop of radius r so that it encloses 
    the current which is going into the page then from Ampere's law 
    <me>
      \oint\vec{B}\cdot\,dl= B_{in}\left.\,dl\right\vert_{0}^{2\pi r} = B(2\pi r) =\mu_{o}I_{enc} =\mu_{o}n(2\pi r)I
