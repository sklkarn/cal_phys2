  <introduction>
   <p>
    When objects size (such as plane mirror or curvature) are larger than the wavelength of light, 
    then the behavior of light can be understood using ray optics such as in reflection, refraction, 
    dispersion, etc. in geometric optics. On the other hand, when size of the objects are comparable 
    to the wavelength of light, then the behavior of light when it interacts with the objects can 
    only be understood using wave properties of light. Physical optics is a part of optics which deals 
    with the phenomenon of light on the basis of wave nature of light such as interference, diffraction, polarization, etc.

    <title>Interference</title>
   <introduction>
    <p>
      When two or more waves interact simultaneously at any particle in a medium, the resultant 
      displacement of the particle at that instant is given by the superposition of all these waves.  
      After the superposition from the region of overlapping these waves emerge as if they have not 
      interfered at all. Each wave retains its individual characteristics and behaves as if others were not there. 
      This behavior is known as <term>principle of superposition</term>.  
      The principle of superposition states that when two or more waves meet at a point, 
      the total displacement is the vector sum of the displacements that each individual wave would cause at that point.

  <p>
    The phenomenon of overlapping of two or more waves at a point in space is called an <term>interference</term>.  
    Suppose two waves of same amplitudes and frequencies superimpose on each other at a point (in same phase) 
    in such a way that the crest of one falls on the crest of the other or the trough of one falls on 
    the trough of the other then the amplitude of the particle is twice the amplitude of either of the waves. 
    At these points, the waves reinforce with each other. If they superimpose in (opposite phase) such a way 
    that the crest of one falls on the trough of the other then the amplitude is zero. 
    At these points, the waves cancel out the displacement of the particle due to each other.  
    It is possible that in some region of space the energy is more than the energy due to individual 
    waves and in some other region, it is less than that due to individual waves. Hence, the phenomenon of 
    redistribution of energy due to superposition of waves is also termed as <em>interference</em>. 
    This redistribution of energy depends upon the frequency, amplitude, and the phases of individual waves. 
    It should be remembered that there is no loss of energy due to interference. Since intensity is proportional 
    to square of amplitude, the intensity at a maximum displacement is four times than the intensity 
    due to one of the waves. The interference with maximum intensity or maximum amplitude is known as 
    <term>constructive interference</term> and those with minimum intensity or minimum amplitude is known as 
    <term>destructive interference</term>. 
    The interference phenomenon was first demonstrated clearly in Young's experiment in 1802.

    A sunlight is allowed to pass through a pinhole S and then at some distance away on two other pinholes 
    <m>S_{1}</m> and <m>S_{2}</m> as shown in <xref ref="youngs2"/>.  <m>S_{1}</m> and <m>S_{2}</m> 
    are equidistant from S and are very close to each other. When a spherical wavefront from S reaches 
    to  <m>S_{1}</m> and <m>S_{2}</m> it distributed into two separate wavefronts of identical in nature 
    (Huygen's principle). When these wavefronts superimpose to each other on the screen dark and bright 
    bands can be observed clearly. The point such as O on the screen is bright because the crest of 
    one wave falls on the crest of another (or trough of one falls on the trough of the other). 
    Hence they reinforce each other. The points such as P are dark because the crest of one wave falls 
    on the trough of the other wave and they neutralize the effect of each other.

   <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-coherent">
    <title>Coherent Sources</title>
    <p>
      It is not possible to have interference due to two independent sources of light because 
      they are not similar to each other and can not maintain a constant phase difference. 
      To have a sustained interference the two waves must be coherent (i.e., they have same wavelength, 
      amplitude, and in a constant phase difference), and must be moving nearly parallel to each other. 
      Since the wavelength of light is extremely small (of the order of <m>10^{-5}\, cm</m>), 
      the two sources must be narrow and very close to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two wave sources are said to be <term>coherent</term> if they emit light waves of  same frequency 
      (i.e. same wavelength), same amplitude, and in a constant phase difference with each other. 
      In practice, it is not possible to have two independent sources which are coherent. 
      A source of light consists of a large number of atoms and light pulse is emitted when an electron 
      from higher energy levels falls onto a lower energy levels in an excited atom. 
      The emission of light pulse from various atoms is random and hence such light 
      pulses do not have constant phase relationship.

    <p>
      For sustained interference the superposing waves must be in constant phase difference 
      which can be achieved through the following two methods called wavefront division  
      or amplitude division. In wavefront division very narrow slits are taken help to divide the 
      wavefront and form two virtual sources. According to Huygens principle every points on a wavefront 
      behave as secondary sources that are vibrating in phase. Therefore portions of wave front cut by 
      holes (or slits) are coherent sources and waves emitted by them are also coherent as shown in <xref ref="coherent1"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In amplitude division coherent sources are formed by dividing the amplitude of wave by 
      multiple reflection and refraction by a thin transparent film. A ray of light gets partly 
      reflected as ray <m>A_{1}</m> and partly refracted when incident on a thin transparent film. 
      At the point of incidence the refracted ray is again partly reflected and emerges out 
      from the upper surface as ray <m>A_{2}</m>. At every stage of reflection and refraction 
      the intensity of light decreases. Now, intensity is proportional to square of amplitude 
      hence at each stage amplitude is divided. Since, both rays have been obtained from a single ray, 
      they are coherent as shown in <xref ref="coherent2"/>.

          From eqn. <xref ref="eqn-interf1"/>, it is clear that intensity is <m>4a^{2}</m> 
          at bright point and zero at dark point. Hence the energy is transferred from dark point to bright point. 
          The intensity of the bright points due to two waves without interference would be <m>2a^{2}</m> 
          which is the same as the average intensity after interference <m>\frac{4a^{2}+0}{2}=2a^{2}</m> (<xref ref="grinterfer"/>). 
          The waves emitting from the sources <m>S_{1}</m> and <m>S_{2}</m> are in phase hence, whether 
          the point P is bright or dark depends upon the path difference of these waves when reach to point P. 
          The path difference between waves at point P is given by

        As a light wave incident from the air into the soap film, part of it reflects off the top surface. 
        When it does, it reflects inverted because it was moving from less dense air to more dense soap film.  
        Most of the light energy transmitted into the soap film  where a small part of it reflects off again 
        from the bottom surface of the soap film. This time, the wave reflects unchanged because it was 
        going from more dense soap film to less dense air. When this wave energy transmits back into the air, 
        it is <em>out-of-phase</em> with the wave that is reflecting off the top surface. 
        This means that a crest of one matches up with a trough of the other. Interference of waves 
        tells us that they will cancel each other out at this point. The overall effect is that some of 
        the colors in the original white light disappear altogether, leaving other colors behind. 
        These are the colors you see in soap bubbles.

        We may have seen a geometrical shadow around the bright spot when the light coming through a 
        hole falls on a screen. If the size of hole is decreased gradually, the brightness also 
        spreads over the geometrical shadow region, which could not be explained on the basis of 
        geometrical optics. Such phenomenon of bending of light around the corners of a narrow aperture 
        or obstacle and spreading of light waves into geometrical shadow is called <term>diffraction</term>. 
        It is also a superposition of two light waves just as in case of interference. 
        The difference is that when two wavefronts from coherent sources are superimposed 
        interference takes place but when two secondary wavelets of a same wavefront superimpose 
        diffraction takes place. Hence two coherent sources are mandatory for interference pattern 
        but only one source is sufficient enough to produce diffraction pattern. Thus diffraction is a 
        superposition of two or more secondary wavelets. The diffraction phenomena can only 
        be explained on the basis of wave theory of light.

        Consider a monochromatic light from a source S is passing through samll aperture MN and 
        falls on the screen XY. On the screen AB is a bright portion and the portion above point A 
        and below point B is geometric shadow. From the rectilinear propagation of light the 
        geometrical shadow region must be completely dark but we know that the there is an encroachment 
        of light and shadow is no longer a complete dark rather darkness prevails more as we go further 
        above A or below B as shown in <xref ref="diffapert"/>. Similarly, if an opaque obstacle MN 
        is placed in the path of light there should be illumination in the geometrical shadow region AB 
        also as shown in <xref ref="diffobst"/>. In order to see the illumination in a geometrical 
        shadow the size of the obstacle must be comparable to the wavelength of light.

        Light waves have very small wavelength from <m>4\times10^{-7}\,m</m> mto <m>7 \times 10^{-7}\, m</m>. 
        If the size of opening or obstacle is near to this limit, then only diffraction takes place. 
        Huygens wavelets theory with the help of principle of interference can explain satisfactorily 
        the bending effect of light around the obstacles. Diffraction phenomena can be divided into two types: 
        <em>Fresnel diffraction</em> and <em>Fraunhofer diffraction</em>. In Fresnel class, the source and the 
        screen  are taken at finite distances from the aperture or obstacle. In Fraunhofer class, 
        the source and the screen  are taken virtually at infinite distances from the aperture or obstacle. 
        The incoming light is rendered parallel with a lens and the diffracted beam is focused on the 
        screen with another lens.  Fresnel diffraction does not require any lens.  
        A plane wavefront is considered in Fraunhofer diffraction. We discuss here only Fraunhoffer type diffraction.

          Consider a plane wavefront is incident on the slit AB and each point on this wavefront 
          behaves as a source of secondary disturbance (Huygen's principle). The secondary waves  
          (wavelets) from A and B reach the point O after traveling the equal distance  
          and produce the central bright fringe. The path difference between the waves 
          from A and B to point O is zero. Hence, the secondary waves reinforce each other at point O 
          and the point O will be of maximum intensity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now consider the secondary waves from point A travel with the inclination <m>\theta</m> 
          reach the point P. All the secondary waves from slit when reach the point P then point P 
          will be of maximum or minimum intensity depending on the path difference between them 
          originating from the corresponding points of the wavefront on slit. Draw BL normal on BP, 
          then from <m>\triangle ABL</m>,  
          <me>
            \sin\theta =\frac{BL}{a} \quad \Rightarrow BL=a\sin\theta
          </me>
          where a is the width of the slit and BL is the path difference between secondary waves 
          originating from points A and B. If <m>BL = \lambda</m>, then point P will be a point of minimum intensity. 
          To understand this concept divide the  wavefront into two halves AC and BC and if the path difference 
          between the secondary waves from A and B is <m>\lambda</m>, then path difference between the secondary 
          waves from point A and C will be <m>\frac{\lambda}{2}</m>. Similarly from every point in the upper half 
          AC there is a corresponding point in the lower half BC and the path difference between the secondary 
          waves from these points is  <m>\frac{\lambda}{2}</m>. Thus, destructive interference takes place 
          and the point P will be of minimum intensity. If <m>BL=2\lambda</m>, then also the point where 
          they meet on the screen will be of minimum intensity. To understand this concept the wavefront 
          AB now can be divided into four quarters. The secondary waves from first quarter meet on that 
          from second quarter on screen in opposite phase, i.e. in <m>\frac{\lambda}{2}</m> path difference 
          and cancel out each other. Hence the point on screen will be of minimum intensity. 
          In general for secondary minima

          <men xml:id="eqn-ssdiffr1">
            a\sin\theta_{n}=n\lambda 
          </men>
          where <m>\theta_{n}</m> gives the direction of <m>n^{th}</m> minimum, here <m>n =1,2,3,\cdots</m>. 
          If, however, the path difference is odd multiple of <m>\frac{\lambda}{2}</m>, 
          the direction of secondary maxima can be obtained. In this case, 
          <men xml:id="eqn-ssdiffr2">
            a\sin\theta_{n}=(2n+1)\frac{\lambda}{2} 
          </men>
          Thus, the diffraction pattern due to a single slit consists of a central bright maximum at 
          O followed by secondary maxima and minima on both sides. All waves do not interfere 
          constructively for this situation, and so the maximum is not as intense as the central maximum. 
          The intensity distribution on the screen is given in <xref ref="diffgraph"/>. 
          The secondary maxima are of much less intensity and the intensity also falls of rapidly from 
          the point O outwards. From <xref ref="diffraction1"/>, we have 
          <me>

      <title>Double Slits Diffraction</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          If the width of slit is very narrow such as <m>a \lt \lt \lambda</m>, then in the double-slit experiment, 
          the central maximum of the diffraction pattern of either slit covers the entire viewing screen and the 
          interference of light produces bright fringes with approximately the same intensity. In practice, however, 
          the condition <m>a \lt \lt \lambda</m> is not met. For relatively wide slits <xref ref="ddiff"/>, the interference of light 
          from two slits produces bright fringes that do not all have the same intensity. That is, the intensities 
          of the fringes produced by double-slit interference are modified by diffraction of the light passing through each slit.

  The intensity of <xref ref="ddiff"/>suggests the double-slit interference pattern that would occur 
  if the slits were infinitely narrow; all the bright interference fringes would have the same intensity. 
  The intensity plot of <xref ref="ddiff"/> is that for diffraction by a single slit; the diffraction pattern has 
  a broad central maximum and weaker secondary maxima. The plot of <xref ref="diffgraph3"/> suggests the interference 
  pattern for two actual slits. That plot was constructed by using the curve of <xref ref="ddiff"/> as an envelope 
  on the intensity plot in <xref ref="diffgraph3"/>. The positions of the fringes are not changed; only the intensities are affected.

  Double slit diffraction can be explained as a combination of

      the interference pattern due to secondary waves coming from the corresponding points of the two slits and

            <p>
              Diffraction grating is a collection of large number of narrow slits on a plane surface (or spherical surface). 
              The most common type of diffraction gratings are plane gratings and concave gratings. 
              When the incident wavefront on a grating surface is transmitted through the slits and obstructed by 
              the opaque portions it is called a transmission grating. If a fine lines are drawn on a plane glass plate using 
              diamond, then the space between the lines is transparent to light and lines are opaque to light. 
              Such surface acts as a transmission grating.

              If the lines are drawn on a silvered glass surface then light is reflected from the surface between two 
              lines and such surface acts as a reflecting grating. The separation between the slits are comparable 
              to the wavelength of light under study. The separation between two adjacent slits is known as granting element. 
              If N is number of lines drawn on a length L then the grating element can be given as

              A spectrometer is a device used to study the spectrum of light. A grating is a heart of 
              spectrometer as it disperses light of different wavelengths into narrow fringes. 
              The angles of deviation of maxima of these fringes are then used to measure the  wavelength precisely.

            Light is an electromagnetic wave of transverse in nature. Interference and diffraction phenomena 
            proved that the light is a wave but could not explain whether it is a transverse or a longitudinal. 
            The polarization of wave helps explain that the light is transverse in nature. When light wave propagates 
            along x-axis, the electric field and magnetic field oscillate along all possible directions which are 
            perpendicular to the x-axis, <xref ref="polr1a"/>. Since magnetic field is always perpendicular to 
            the electric field, <xref ref="polr1b"/> and is much smaller than it (<m>\vec{E}=c\vec{B}</m>) we usually take 
            the electric field to characterize the property of polarization of light.

            If light wave is propagating along x-axis, then electric field <m>\vec{E}</m> oscillates in the xy plane 
            and magnetic field <m>\vec{B}</m> oscillates in the xz plane. Normally, any light source emits unpolarized 
            light, i.e. electric field could vibrates along all possible directions perpendicular to the light propagation. 
            Hence, polarization is a phenomenon of restricting the vibration of electric filed in a single plane. 
            Light is said to be linearly polarized if the direction of oscillation of electric field is confined to 
            one direction. Polarization direction is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation and electric 
            field vector oscillates in a plane of polarization.

            through both the slits irrespective of their orientations.
