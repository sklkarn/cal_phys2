          I would like to thank my colleagues and students for the contributions they have 
          made to improve this book through questionnaires, classroom discussion, and their 
          invaluable feedback and support throughout the writing process. I am especially 
          very grateful to John Gould and Daniel Covington for 
          providing their critical suggestions to organize this book. Without their guidance, 
          this book would not be what it is today. Their knowledge and expertise were instrumental 
          in shaping my journey in writing this book. Finally, I want to express my gratitude to 
          my family for their unwavering encouragement and patience during the many long hours 
          I spent at my desk. Their love and support sustained me through the ups and downs 
          of this project. Several others deserve credit for their generous help in this book.

          General physics is a calculus-based introductory physics book. 
          This book is a concise form of my lecture notes that I have been 
          delivering in my introductory level courses for many years. 
          This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the 
          instructor but is designed to support calculus-based physics materials 
          at a rapid and an efficient way in my personal teaching activities. 
          Students who want to use this text assume to have prerequisite knowledge 
          of some basic mathematical skills such as geometry, algebra, trigonometry, 
          and some advanced mathematical tools such as a differential and integral calculus. 
         </p>

            Learning skills by memorization cannot seem to be working efficiently 
            in learning physics. Physics is a logical and conceptual based learning 
            hence it requires a completely different approach than simply trying to 
            memorize lists of formulae or examples. 
           This book is organized into two volumes that covers the syllabus 
           of introductory physics at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. 
          <term>General Physics I</term>  contains <em>Basics of Mechanics,  Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics. </em>
           <term>General Physics II</term> contains <em>Electricity, Magnetism, Waves, Acoustics, and Optics.</em> 
             These topics have been carefully chosen to provide an introduction to the 
           basic concepts in physics and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking 
           and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to learn how to 
           investigate and approach problems in a logical manner. This book strives to 
           guide readers to  learn physics in a logical manner. Many examples and practice 
           problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition. 
           </p>
            <p>
              To tackle the physical problems the book uses the 'GUESS' policy for a 
              systematic gatheing of information and finding realistic and logistic solution. 
              Here is what GUESS stands for </p>
              <p>
                <alert>G:</alert> Given, identify the given information and sketch the information if possible. 
              </p>
<p>
  <alert>U:</alert> Unknown, identify the unknown that we are looking for.
</p>
<p>
  <alert>E:</alert> Equation/s, set up the equation from given information.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>S:</alert> Substitute, substitute the number/s in the equation/s.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>S:</alert> Solve, solve the equation to obtain the answer.
</p>

  Comments and suggestions for improvements to the text will be gratefully
