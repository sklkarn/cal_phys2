  <title>Magnetic Force on a Current Element</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The force on a current element when placed in a magnetic field, <m>B</m> is

      is perpendicular to the plane subtends by <m>\vec{B}</m> and <m>\vec{l}</m>

      of current element and curl that up along the direction of magnetic field 
      then thumb will pointed along the force acting on that current element.

            Consider a differential charge, <m>\,dq</m> to be moving with a velocity,

  <p>
    A solenoid [<xref ref="solenoid"/>] is a tightly wound helical coil of wire whose diameter is small compared to its length. 
    The magnetic field generated inside the current carrying solenoid is essentially uniform, 
    and is directed along the axis of the solenoid. Outside the solenoid, the magnetic field 
    is very weak. The winding of wire is sufficiently tight that each turn of the solenoid 
    is well approximated as a circular wire loop, lying in the plane perpendicular to the axis 
    of the solenoid, which carries a current I. If a solenoid of length l has total number of 
    turns N then the magnetic field (i.e. total magnetic moments) along the axis of a 
    solenoid is  given by <m>\mu = N I A</m>.

  <title>Magnetic Torque on a Current Loop</title>
  <p>
    If a current loop is placed in an external magnetic field [<xref ref="torq2"/>], it experiences a force 
    that tends to rotate it in such a way that the surface of the loop is perpendicular 
    to the field, i.e., the field and area vector become parallel to each other. 
    The torque <m>\tau</m> (or moment of force) on the loop is a vector product 
    of the force F and the lever arm r. That is, 
    <me>
      \vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times \vec{F}

      Consider a rectangular current loop ABCDA of surface area  A,  side length = L, 
      and side width = W is placed in an external magnetic field  B  [<xref ref="dipoletorq"/>] so that xz plane 
      is parallel to the field, then the torque acting on the loop is given by 
      <me>
        \tau = r F = \frac{L}{2}F_{out} + \frac{L}{2}F_{in}
      </me>
     Where,  <m>r = OA= \frac{L}{2}, </m> the perpendicular distance of <m>F_{out}</m> 
     or <m>F_{in}</m> from the axis of rotation.  Force along sides EA and BD is zero as 
     <m>\vec{B}</m> and current element <m>Il</m> is parallel to each other. Force  <m>F_{out}</m> 
     is coming out of the page along +ve y-axis and <m>F_{in}</m> is going into the page 
     along -ve y-axis. 
     <me>
      \tau = \frac{L}{2}\left[F_{out} + F_{in}\right]
     </me>
     <me>
      \text{But,}\quad F = IlB

   <me>
  \text{or,}\quad \tau = \frac{L}{2}\left[IWB + IWB\right]

here <m>l=W</m> width of the rectangular plane. Hence, 
<me>
  \tau= \frac{L}{2}\left[2IWB\right] = ILWB = IAB = \mu B
</me>
Due to this torque xz-plane rotates about z-axis till it orient parallel to yz-plane. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In vector form 
      <me>
        \vec{\tau}=\vec{\mu}\times\vec{B}
      </me>
       It's direction is perpendicular to the plane made by <m>\vec{\mu}</m>
       and <m>\vec{B}</m>. Forces acting on a plane to reduce the torque. 
       That is, the torque rotates the loop to align dipole  moment and an external field in the same direction.

  <title>Potential Energy of Magnetic Dipole</title>

    When a torque is applied on a dipole which is free to rotate, work is done. 
    The incremental work done by the field when a magnetic dipole is rotated through 
    an angle <m>\,d\theta</m> as shown in <xref ref="torq3"/> is: 
    <me>
      \,dW = -\tau\cdot\,d\theta = -\mu B\sin\theta \,d\theta
    </me>
    where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\vec{\mu}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m>. 
    The work done is equal to the decrease in potential energy of the system, i.e.,

        \therefore\quad U =\int\,dU= \int\mu B\sin \theta\,d\theta =- \mu B \cos\theta+C_{o}

      Where <m>C_{o}</m> is the integration constant. When <m>U</m> is zero  at

      This is potential energy of a magnetic dipole at an angle <m>\theta</m> to the direction 
      of a magnetic field <xref ref="gr6"/>. Potential energy <m>U</m> is minimum at <m>\theta=0</m> 
      and provides stable equilibrium, where as <m>U</m> is maximum at <m>\theta=180^{o}</m> 
      provides unstable equilibrium. Remember that the torque acts to align the dipole 
      with <m>\vec{\mu}</m> parallel to <m>\vec{B}.</m>
