  <title>Conduction Mechanism of Current in a Metal</title>
  
<introduction>
  <p>
    When an electric field is applied between two ends of a conductor then 
    electrons experience a electrostatics force due to which they begin to drift in a conductor.

  <p>
    Consider a conductor of length <m>L</m>, area of cross-section <m>A</m>, 
    is subjected to an electric field <m>E</m> due to which a charge <m>\,dq</m>  
    crosses one section of a conductor [<xref ref="conduction"/>] in time <m>\,dt</m>, then current 
    <me>
      I = \frac{\,dq}{\,dt}
    </me>
    If there are <m>N</m> number of charge carriers cross through a section of the 
    conductor, then 
    <me>
      I= \frac{\,d(N e)}{\,dt}
    </me>
    where <m>e</m> is the charge of each charge carrier (or an electron). Hence,
    <md>
      <mrow> I\amp = \frac{\,dq}{\,dt} </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = \frac{\,d(N e)}{\,dt}</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp  = e\,\frac{\,dN }{\,dt}  </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp =e \,\frac{n \,dV}{\,dt} </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp =e\frac{nA\,dx}{\,dt}</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp =n e v_{d}A</mrow>
    </md>
    <men xml:id="eqn-current3">
      I = n e v A
    </men>
     where <m>A</m> is area of cross-section of the conductor, <m>n</m> is the number density 
    (<m>n=\frac{\,dN}{\,dV},</m> ) and <m>v_{d}=v</m> is a drift velocity of electrons. 
    <fn><term>Note:</term> In <xref ref="conduction"/> positive charges are shown crossing 
      a section of conductor along the direction of applied electric field to acquire a 
      current I but in reality electrons are drifting in a conductor just opposite to the electric field.</fn>
  </p>
  <p>
   <term> Number density, <m>n</m></term> is defined as number of charge carriers per unit volume 
   of the conductor. It is different for different materials. Now from eqn. <xref ref="eqn-current2"/> 
   the current density, <m>J</m> is given by
   <me>
    J = \frac{I}{A} = nev
   </me>
  Its direction is along the direction of flow of positive charge.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Resistance, <m>R</m>:</term> It is a restriction imposed on the motion of a current 
    in a conductor. Motion of charge carriers (electrons) are not very smooth in a conductor 
    as they bump onto the other electrons and positive charge residual atoms during their motion. 
    Such restrictions (or, obstacles) in flow of electrons is measured as a resistance of the
    conductor in current flow. Its unit is Ohm (<m>\Omega</m>).

<subsection xml:id="subsec-ohm_law">
  <title>Ohm's Law:</title>
  <introduction>
   
  <p>
  In 1827, George Simon Ohm studied that the current flowing through a conductor is 
  directly proportional to the potential difference applied between its two ends at 
  constant physical conditions (<em>Temperature, light, electric, or magnetic field.</em>) i.e. 
  <me>
    I  \propto V \quad \text{at constant T.}
  </me>
  <men xml:id="eqn-current4">
    \text{or,} \quad I  = k V
  </men>
  where <m>k</m> is a proportionality constant and known as a conductance of a conductor. 
  Usually <m>k = 1/R</m>, <m>R</m> being resistance of the conductor. Hence 
  <me>
    I=\frac{V}{R}
  </me>
  <men xml:id="eqn-current5">
    \text{or,} \quad V =IR 
  </men>
    </p>
     </introduction>


<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-restvty">
  <title> Resistivity or Specific Resistance, <m>\rho</m>:</title>
  <p>
   We know that if a conductor of length <m>L</m> has a potential difference across 
   its ends is <m>V</m> then electric field can be given as [<xref ref="eqn-elpotgrd1"/>]
   <me>
    E= \frac{V}{L}
   </me>
   and if current, <m>I</m> is flowing in this conductor of area of cross-section <m>A</m>, 
   then current density is <m> J=\frac{I}{A} </m>.
   Now using Ohm's law, we have 
   <me>
    E=\frac{IR}{L} = \left(\frac{RA}{L}\right)J 
   </me>
   In this expression resistance <m>R</m> of the conductor of the given length <m>L</m> 
   and area of cross-section <m>A</m> are all constant. Hence we can write electrical field as 
   <me>
    E=\rho J
   </me>
  where 
  <men xml:id="eqn-sp_rest1">
    \rho= R\frac{A}{L}
  </men>
   is known as a specific resistance or resistivity of the conductor. It is a property of the 
   material. Different material has a different resistivity. If a conductor of length <m>L=1\,m</m> 
   has a cross-section area <m>A=1\,m^{2}</m> then 
   <me>
    \rho=R
   </me>
    i.e., resistivity of a conductor is a resistance of a unit length of the conductor of unit area cross-section. 
    It's unit is <m>\Omega \,m </m> 
    <me>
      R  =  \frac{\rho L}{A}
    </me>
    The reciprocal of resistivty is known as <term>conductivity</term>, 
    <me>
      \sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}
    </me>
  Such expression allows us to compare electrical field with current density such as 
  <me>
    E=\rho J
  </me>
  <me>
    \text{or}\quad J=\sigma E
  </me>
    </p>

<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-temp_restvty">
  <title>Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity</title>
  <p>
    The resistivity of a conductor varies with temperature such that 
    <me>
      \rho_{t} =	\rho_{o}+at+bt^{2}+\cdots
    </me>
    where <m>\rho_{t},\quad \rho_{o} </m> are resistivity at temperature <m>t</m> and <m>0\,^{o}C</m>	
    and <m>a,\,b,\,c</m> are constants whose value depend on material. If temperature <m>t</m> 
    is not sufficiently large then higher order terms are neglected hence, 
    <me>
      \rho_{t} =	\rho_{o}+at = \rho_{o}\left(1+\frac{a}{\rho_{o}}t\right)=\rho_{o}\left(1+\alpha t\right)
    </me>
    <me>
      \text{or,}\quad \alpha = \frac{\rho_{t}-\rho_{o}}{\rho_{o}t}
    </me>
    Here the constant <m>\alpha</m> is called temperature coefficient of resistivity of a conductor. 
    It defines the material property. Now as resistance is proportional to the resistivity, we can write 
    <men xml:id="eqn-sp_rest2">
      R = R_{o}[1 +\alpha(t-t_{o})] 
    </men>
    i.e., a resistance or resistivity of metallic conductors increases with temperature.

<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-el_power">
  <title>Electrical Power:</title>
  <p>
    It is a measure of energy transferred or consumed by an electrical component per unit time i.e., 
    <men xml:id="eqn-el_power1">
      P=\frac{Energy}{time} = \frac{qV}{t}=IV
    </men>
   <me>
    \text{or,}\quad P = V I

   it's unit is Watts (= J/s).
