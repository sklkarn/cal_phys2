<introduction>
  <p>
    <term>Electrical Work:</term> When an electric force displaces a charged particle 
    an electrical work is said to done. Since charge experience electric force only in an 
    electric field such work is stored on a charged particle as an electric potential 
    energy at that point. In other words, electrical work is an electrical potential 
    energy, i.e., 
    <me>
      W=F_{e}d
    </me>
    here, <m> F_{e}</m> stands for electrostatic force. 
<me>
  \text{or,}\quad W_{ab} = \int\limits_{a}^{b}\vec{F_{a}}\cdot\vec{dl} = -\int\limits_{a}^{b}\vec{F_{e}}\cdot\vec{dl} 
</me>
Here <m>F_{a}</m> is an applied force, which moves the charged particle in an electric field 
without acceleration. Unit of electrical work is Joule,J = Nm (Newton.meter).
  </p>

  <p>
    <term>Electric Potential Energy:</term> The energy stored on a charged particle due its position 
    in an electric field of other charge or charges. It is denoted by <m>U</m>. 
    <me>
      \Delta U = U_{b} - U_{a} =  - W_{ab}
    </me>
   (i.e., Potential energy of b with respect to a).
    <me>
      \Delta U  =-q_{o} \int\limits_{a}^{b}\vec{E}\cdot\vec{dl} = - q_{o} E d
    </me>
   (for Uniform Electric Field). 
  </p>
  <p>Electrical force is a conservative force and when conservative force does negative work, 
    the system gains potential energy. When conservative force does positive work, the system loses 
    potential energy. Therefore if <m>\Delta U \lt 0,</m> charge moves along the direction 
    of electric field. Unit of electric potential energy is Joule.
  </p>

  <p>
    <term>Electric Potential: </term> It is a work done on a unit positive charge to bring it 
    from infinity to any point in an electrical field of other charge/s. In other words, 
    electric potential is an electric potential energy of a unit positive charge at a point 
    in any field, i.e., electric potential energy per unit charge is known as electric potential 
    at a point in any field.  It is a scalar physical quantity. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    Let <m>q</m> is any charge and its electric potential energy at that point in a field is 
    <m>U</m> then electric potential at that point is 
    <me>V = \frac{U}{q},</me> 
    <me>
      \text{or,}\quad U = W = qV.
    </me>
    <me>
      \text{But}\quad \Delta V  = \frac{\Delta U }{q_{o}}
    </me>
    <me>
      = -\int\limits_{a}^{b}\vec{E}\cdot\vec{dl} = -\int\limits_{a}^{b}\frac{kq}{r^{2}}\,dr= k\frac{q}{r}
    </me>
    (for a point charge).
  </p>
  <p>
    Where <me>
      \hat{r}\cdot\vec{\,dr}=\,dr,
    </me>
      point <m>b</m> is taken at <m>\infty</m> and point <m>a</m> is at any point in the electric field. 
      Unit of electric potential is Volt (V) = Joule/Coulomb (J/C). Remember that we can only 
      define the potential <m>V</m> at a point if the force is conservative. <fn><term>Conservative Force:</term> 
        It is a force which is directed along a certain fixed point. Workdone by these force around a closed 
        path is always zero. Gravitational force, electric force, elastic spring force, are some examples 
        of conservative forces. <term>Non-conservative force:</term> It is a force which change its 
        direction depends upon the object motion. Workdone by these force around a closed path 
        is always non-zero. Frictional force, viscous force, air drag force or any kind 
        of resistive forces are non-conservative forces.</fn>
  </p>
  <p>
   <term> Potential Difference:</term> It is a work done on a unit positive charge to bring 
   it from one point to another point in a field, e.g., if a unit positive charge is brought 
   from a point of electric potential <m>V_{a}</m> to another point of potential <m>V_{b}</m> 
   then potential difference between the points is 
   <me>
    V_{ba} = \Delta V  =  V_{b} - V_{a} 
   </me>
   (Potential of b with respect to a).
    <me>
      V_{ba} = -\int\limits_{a}^{b}\vec{E}\cdot\vec{dl}
    </me>
    (Two Point Charges).
  </p>
  <p>
    -ve sign indicates that charge is brought against an electric field, i.e., direction of 
    force is opposite to the displacement. The work is a negative change in potential energy. 
    If work done by a force is positive then potential energy is decreasing and vice a versa.	
    Unit of potential difference is <em>Volt</em>.	
  </p>

  <p>
   <term> Gradient:</term> <idx><h>gradient</h></idx> 
   It is a change in scalar field <fn><em>Fields:</em> A field is a region of space whose 
    every point defines some kind of physical quantities. Depending upon the nature of physical 
    quantity there are two types of field, scalar field and vector field. A force field defines 
    a force vector at every location in space. A magnetic field defines a magnetic field vector 
    at every location in space. A potential energy field defines a potential energy at every 
    location in space. The gravitational field is a vector field which expresses the value of 
    gravitational force, and Higg's field is a scalar field which defines the mass or energy of 
    a particle. If <m>\phi (x,y,z)</m> is a scalar function associated with every point (x,y,z) 
    of any region in space, then the region is defined as a scalar field. Again, if 
    <m>\vec{V}(x,y,z)</m> is a vector associated with every point (x,y,z) of any region in space, 
    then the region is defined as a vector field.</fn> with respect to space and is a vector quantity 
   whose direction is acting along the greatest change in that field. The gradient of a scalar 
   field <m>\phi</m> is defined as  
   <me>
    \text{grad}\phi =  \hat{i}\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} + \hat{j}\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} 
    + \hat{k}\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} 
   </me>
   <me>
    = \left(\hat{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} 
    + \hat{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)\phi = \vec{\nabla\phi}
   </me>
   where an operator <me>
    \nabla = \hat{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \hat{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}
   </me>
     is known as <m>'Del'</m> operator and read as a gradient or a grad, which is a vector quantity. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <term>Potential Gradient:</term> 
    <me>
      \Delta V  = -\frac{W}{q}= -\frac{F\Delta l}{q}=-\frac{qE\Delta l}{q} = -E\Delta l
    </me>
     		<me>
          \text{or,} \quad E = -\frac{\Delta V }{\Delta l}
        </me>
        <me>
          \therefore\quad \vec{E}  =  - \vec{\nabla} V
        </me>
        Unit of potential gradient is V/m or N/C.
  </p>

  <p>
   <term> Equipotential Surfaces:</term> 
   The portion of an electric field upon which the electrical potential has a fixed value 
   is called a equipotential surfaces. Thus, <m>\Delta V= 0</m> between any two points on the 
   equipotential surface, i.e., no work is required to move any charge on an equipotential 
   surface. For a positive point charge equipotential surfaces are concentric spherical 
   surfaces around charge at center as shown in <xref ref="equipot"/>. Equipotential surfaces 
   for a positive and negative charges are shown in <xref ref="elect"/>, 
   and that for two similar charges are shown in <xref ref="elect2"/>.

    <term>Corona Discharge:</term> <idx>corona discharge</idx> 
    It is an electrical discharge appearing on and around the surface of a conductor 
    by ionization of the surrounding fluid molecules. when a conductor of very 
    large curvature is exposed in a very high electric field  corona discharge occurs. 
    The phenomenon of corona discharge can be understood by the following concept.

    Consider two conducting spherical sells of radius <m>r_{1}</m> and <m>r_{2}</m> 
    containing charges <m>q_{1} </m> and <m> q_{2}</m>. The potential on the surface 
    of these sells are 
    <me>
      V_{1} = \frac{kq_{1}}{r_{1}}
    </me>
     and 
     <me>
      V_{2} = \frac{kq_{2}}{r_{2}},
     </me>
     respectively. Suppose they are so designed that they have same potential on the surface, i.e., 
     <me>
      V_{1}= V_{2}
     </me>
     <me>
      \text{or,}\quad \frac{kq_{1}}{r_{1}} = \frac{kq_{2}}{r_{2}} 
     </me>
     <me>
      \text{or,}\quad \frac{q_{1}}{q_{2}} = \frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}} 
     </me>
     <me>
      \text{or,}\quad  \frac{\frac{q_{1}}{4\pi r^{2}_{1}}}{\frac{q_{2}}{4\pi r^{2}_{2}}} 
       = \frac{\frac{r_{1}}{4\pi r^{2}_{1}}}{\frac{r_{2}}{4\pi r^{2}_{2}}} 
     </me>
     <me>
      \text{or,}\quad  \frac{\sigma_{1}}{\sigma_{2}}   = \frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}
     </me>
     <me>
      i.e., \quad \sigma  \varpropto \frac{1}{r} 
     </me>
     or, surface charge density is inversely proportional to radius of curvature. 
     Hence, as the radius of curvature of a conductor decreases  (or, its  curvature increases) 
     surface charge density increases. The surface charge density increases enormously at 
     the pointed end of the conductor because of high curvature [<xref ref="egg"/>]. Pointed end 
     produces such a high field that the nearby air molecules stretch as the displacement 
     of center of gravity of their negative and positive charges.  Since opposite charge 
     attracts each other the charges on the conductors start neutralizing with the opposite 
     charge of air molecules by producing bluish light surrounding the conductor without a 
     spark such phenomenon is called a corona discharge. 
     In this case no electrical breakdown occurs in air molecules.

          It is a device designed by Van de Graaff in 1929 to generate very high potential differences. 
          It consists of two combs, a conveyor rubber belt (which is mounted on two motorized rollers), 
          and a large conducting dome. Charges are spread on belt with the help of charged comb as comb 
          discharges its charge on air molecules which later stick onto the belt and carried over near 
          the upper comb which then neutralizes these charges on air molecule because of electrostatic 
          induction.  Hence the similar kind of charges are getting collected on a big spherical 
          dome connected with the upper comb (<xref ref="fig1d"/>).

  <p>
    In any electronic circuit we can see some of these types of devices [<xref ref="capacitors"/>]. 
    They are known as <em>condenser</em> or <term>capacitor</term>.
  </p>
    <p>
      <term>Capacitor:</term> It is a charge storing device. It can store electrical energy in the form 
      of electrical charge that produces potential difference across its plates. Since we can also 
      store charge on a conductor it can also be considered as capacitor but it can store a very 
      limited amount of charge for a short duration only. A capacity of storing charge on a conductor 
      can be increased by arranging two or more parallel conducting surfaces that are placed close 
      to each other with insulating material/s between them, e.g. air and/or any dielectrics. 
      If these surfaces are plane we call it a parallel plate capacitor, if they are cylindrical 
      it is a cylindrical capacitor, and if they are spherical it is a spherical capacitor.

      <term>Capacitance:</term> The capacity of storing charge on a capacitor is termed as capacitance. 
      when an isolated conductor is given a charge it acquires a certain potential. If is found that 
      the potential  V  acquired by the conductor is proportional to the charge  Q  given to it i.e. 
      <me>
        Q \propto V 
      </me>
     <me>
      \text{or,}\quad  Q = CV; 
     </me>
     <me>
       \therefore\quad C  = \frac{Q}{V}.
     </me>
     Here C is a proportionality constant known as capacitance of that conductor (or capacitor). 
     Hence capacitance is defined as the charge required to raise the potential of the conductor 
     by unity. Its unit is <term>Farad</term>. If one coulomb of charge stored in a capacitor of 
     potential difference across the plates is one volt then its capacitance is one Farad. 
     Farad is a very large number. The entire earth as a spherical capacitor has a capacitance of only
     0.0007  Farad. 	
    </p>
    <p>
      The increase of capacitance of a conductor can be understood by the following arrangement. 
      Let A be an isolated conductor which is charged to a maximum potential V  volts. 
      [<em>Note:</em> Potential refers to a potential difference of a conductor with respect to ground.] 
        </p>
       <p>
        Suppose we want to store some more charge on it then we have to reduce its potential 
        somehow before putting any charge. So another isolated conductor B is brought near A 
        then A induces negative charges on the inner surface of B and positive charges on the outer 
        surface as shown in <xref ref="paralleplate1"/>. The negative charge on B tends to reduce the potential 
        of A and positive charge on B tends to increase potential of A. Since negative charges 
        of B are closer to A than the positive charges of B the net potential of A is reduced 
        by some amount. This slight decrees in potential of A results increase of capacitance of A 
        because of relation <me>
          C  = \frac{Q}{V}
        </me>
         remaining Q constant. Hence a more charge can be stored on the same conductor 
         till the potential again reaches to  V.  The capacitance can be considerably high if 
         the conductors are placed very close to each other and a conductor B is grounded (<xref ref="paralleplate"/>).	
         The relation <me>
          V = k\frac{Q}{r}= \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon}\frac{Q}{r}, 
         </me>
          explains that the increase in permitivity of the dielectric medium between conducting 
          plates also increases the capacitance.

            When capacitors are connected in such a way that same charge is seemed to be
