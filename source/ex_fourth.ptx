        Two cars have identical horns which emit <m>200 H_{z}</m> frequencies. The first car is at 
        rest and the second is moving away from the first at 30 m/s. An observer is between the 
        two cars moving away from the first at a speed of 10 m/s. There is a 5 m/s wind blowing 
        toward the first car from the direction of the other two cars. The speed of sound is 340 m/s.

            What is the frequency of the first car as heard by the observer?

        A galaxy is observed to have a red shift in its spectrum which doubles the wavelength 
        of each spectral line. 
        <ol marker="a.">
          <li>
            Is the galaxy moving toward us or away from us?

            How fast is the galaxy moving?

        Two horns using the same design are supposed to be playing (simultaneously) a 
        sustained resonant note of 300.0 Hz, but they are not quite identical so the 
        longer instrument is a bit off. If the beat sound annoys listeners with a 5-second cycle, 
        what is the frequency from the off-tune instrument?
