<introduction>
  <p>
    Electrical circuit is a network of electrical elements through which current can 
    flow in a closed path. Here are some terminologies that are needed to understand the electrical circuit.
  </p>
  <p>
   <term> Electromotive Force:</term> It is an energy required by the source to send a unit 
   positive charge in a closed loop of electrical circuits. In other words, it is a 
   potential difference across two terminals of a source in an open circuit. It is abbreviated 
   by <em>emf</em> and denoted as <m>\mathscr{E}.</m>  Its unit is Volts. 
  </p>
  <p>
<term>Internal Resistance:</term> It is a resistance of a source itself. 
Most voltage source such as battery works when electrolytes dissociate into cations 
and anions  which restrict the flow of current in a circuit and constitutes an internal 
resistance of a source. All most every materials possess internal resistance even 
if a good conductor except superconducting materials within their physical conditions. 
It is denoted by <m>r.</m> 
</p>
<p>
<term>Terminal Voltage: </term> It is a potential difference across the two terminals of a 
source in a closed circuit. It is denoted by <m> V.</m> In a colosed circuit there is a 
load in a circuit. Load is typically any resistance in the circuit and voltage drop 
at load will be the same as voltage accross the opposite terminals of the voltage source.

  <p>
    In <xref ref="battery"/>, <m>R</m> is given as a load and <m>V</m> is potential difference 
    across it. This potential difference is called a terminal potential difference. If switch <m>s</m> is 
    closed then current <m>I</m> starts flowing in the circuit and in this case 
    <me>
      \mathscr{E}= IR+Ir
    </me>
     <me>
      \text{or,}\quad \mathscr{E}=V+Ir
     </me>
     <men xml:id="eqn-emf1">
      \text{or,}\quad \mathscr{E}-V = Ir
     </men>
     
     If <m> I=0</m> then <m> V= \mathscr{E},</m> 
     i.e., emf is a potential difference across the cell in an open circuit.

    <p>
      To understand internal resistance and emf lets consider a lead-acid cell. 
      However, the similar senario could be applied for any other alkaline cells. 
      In lead - acid cell dilute <m>H_{2} SO_{4}</m> has been used as an electrolyte 
      which gets dissociated in <m>H^{+}</m> ions and <m>SO_{4}^{--}</m> ions in aquous 
      environment as shown in <xref ref="PbCell"/>. Now <m>H^{+}</m> ion migrates towards 
      <m>PbO_{2} </m> electrode, captures electron from the electrode and becomes nacent 
      hydrogen atom. Nacent <m>H</m> then reacts with <m>PbO_{2}</m> and forms <m>H_{2}O</m> 
      and <m>PbO</m>.  <m>PbO</m> instantly reacts with <m>H_{2} SO_{4}</m> molecule and 
      converted into <m>PbSO_{4}</m>. As <m>+ve</m> charges start accumulating on <m>PbO_{2} </m> electrode, 
      we call it a <m>+ </m> plate of the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
On the otherhand, <m>SO_{4}^{--}</m> ion attracts towards <m>Pb</m> electrode, dumps its 
negative charges on it and becomes <m>SO_{4} </m> radical which instantly reacts with <m> Pb</m> 
to form <m>PbSO_{4}</m>. In this case <m>Pb</m> electrode starts accumulating <m>-ve</m>  charges 
and becomes a <m>- </m> plate of the cell. This process continues till sufficient charges 
accumulate on these electrodes and it is difficult for the other ions to migrate towards 
these electrodes because of electrostatic repulsion between the same charges. When transferring 
of charges by the ions to their respective electrodes stop then <m>+</m> electrode has 
accumated maximum positive <m>+ve </m> charge and <m>- </m> electrode has accumulated maximum 
negative <m>-ve </m> charge. This condition builds up maximum potential difference between 
the electrodes which is known as electromottife force, <em>emf</em>. The name emf is misleading 
but it came from its founder, "<em>Alessandro Volta</em>" who had used this term as the real 
reason behind the motion of these charges in the external circuit was not known. 
The chemical reactions on the electrodes are summarized as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <m>+</m> plate:
      <me>
        PbO_{2}+2H \quad \longrightarrow \quad PbO + H_{2}O
      </me>
      <me>
        PbO + H_{2}SO_{4} \quad \longrightarrow  \quad PbSO_{4}+H_{2}O
      </me>
            At <m> -</m> plate:
            <me>
              Pb+SO_{4} \quad \longrightarrow  \quad PbSO_{4}
            </me>
            <fn><em>Remember:</em> Anode is the electrode where oxidation occurs and cathode is where reduction occurs. 
             <term> OILRIG:</term> <term>O</term>xydation <term>I</term>s <term>L</term>ossing of electron and 
             <term>R</term>eduction <term>I</term>s <term>G</term>aining of electron.</fn>
     </p>
     <p>
      If a load, R is applied between the electrodes then accumulated negative charges begin 
      to flow from cathode to anode via load as shown in <xref ref="PbCell2"/>. Due to which other 
      +ve and -ve ions again start migrating towards electrodes to perform chemical reaction. 
      Hence accumulation of charges on the electrodes in a solution and discharging via load 
      are continuous by maintaing the equilibrium condition. The voltage at this time between the 
      electrodes is known as <em>terminal voltage</em> or terminal potential difference as shown 
      in <xref ref="grPb"/>. The difference <m>\varepsilon -V </m> is called the lost voltage. 
      Lost voltage is proportional to the current or disacharging rate of the electrodes. 
      The straight line <m>A</m> shows the ideal case of rate of accumulation of charges on the electrodes. 
      The straight line <m>1</m> shows the rate of discharging of electrodes or current through the load. 
      If higher load is applied current decreases on the load depicting line <m>2</m> in the graph. 
      The projection of intersection point between rate of charging and rate of discharging on x axis 
      gives the value of terminal potential difference (voltage). The terminal voltage increases 
      with increasing load thus decreases the lost voltage on the internal resistance. 
      Lost voltage occurs due to drop of voltage on internal resistance. 
      See the equation above <xref ref="eqn-emf1"/>.

        If the same current passes through each of the resistances in a combination

        series and their terminals are connected to the cell of emf <m>E</m>. 
        If a circuit draws current I  from a cell then the same current I will also pass 
        through each of the resistances. Hence from Ohm's law 
        <me>
          E=V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}=IR_{1} + IR_{2} +IR_{3} = I (R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3})

        If the current of a circuit gets distributed while passing through the resistances

<subsection xml:id="subsec-maxptr">
  <title>Maximum Power Transfer Theorem</title>
  <p>
    In an electric circuit emf of a source generates power to the circuit and load dissipates 
    that power. Some of this power is also dissipated at the internal resistance of the source 
    and hence the power transferred to the load is less than the power generated. 
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="maxptr">
    <caption></caption>
    <image source="maxptr.png" width="35%"/>
</figure>
  <p>
    Lets calculate the maximum power transfer to the load. Consider a simple circuit as shown in 
    <xref ref="maxptr"/>. Now, power generated by the source is given by
    <men xml:id="eqn-maxptr1">
      P_{s}=EI   
    </men>
        and power transfered to the load can be
        <men xml:id="eqn-maxptr2">
          P_{l}=VI =I^{2}R   
        </men>
        From Ohm's law, we have 
        <me>
          E= Ir+IR=I(R+r)
        </me>
        <men xml:id="eqn-maxptr3">
          \text{or,}\quad I=\frac{E}{R+r} 5 
        </men>
         Hence, from eqns. <xref ref="eqn-maxptr2"/> and <xref ref="eqn-maxptr3"/> we get- 
         <men xml:id="eqn-maxptr4">
          P=I^{2}R=\left[\frac{E}{R+r}\right]^{2}R=\frac{E^{2}R}{(R+r)^{2}} 
         </men>
          </p>
          <p>
           That is, power transfer depends upon the load resistance. Hence, maximum power transfer can be obtained by
          <md>
            <mrow> \frac{dP}{dR} \amp =0 </mrow>
            <mrow> or, \quad \frac{d}{dR}\left[\frac{E^{2}R}{(R+r)^{2}}\right]\amp =0</mrow>
            <mrow>or, \quad  \frac{E^{2}}{(R+r)^{2}}+R\left[E^{2}\left(\frac{-2}{(R+r)^{3}}\right).1\right] \amp =0</mrow>
            <mrow>or, \quad \frac{E^{2}}{(R+r)^{2}}\left[1-\frac{2R}{R+r}\right]\amp =0 </mrow>
          </md>
            <me>
            \because \frac{E}{R+r}=I \neq 0 \qquad \Rightarrow 1-\frac{2R}{R+r} = 0 
           </me>
           <me>
            \therefore \quad R=r
           </me>
            Thus the source can transfer maximum power to the load only when load resistance is equal to the internal resistance of the source.
