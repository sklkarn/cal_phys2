<introduction>
  <p>
    An instrument used to aid visual observation is known as an optical instrument. 
    Our eye is a natural device to observe objects. Photographic camera, microscope, 
    telescope, etc. are some of the examples of optical instruments.

  <title>Camera</title>
  <p>
    A photographic camera consists of a convex lens, a photo sensitive plate, and a focusing arrangement 
    as shown in <xref ref="camera"/>. Two achromatic lenses are spaced the proper distance apart, 
    and an adjustable aperture called diaphragm, D is placed between them to permits different amount of 
    light to enter the camera. A shutter is placed near the diaphragm to admit light for a preset time 
    interval depends upon the brightness of the object,  sensitivity of photographic emulsion, the focal 
    length of the lens, and the size of the stop of the aperture.

  <p>
    The diameter, D of the stop is given as a fraction of the focal length, f of the lens system 
    and the ratio of focal length to the diameter of the stop is called the <m>f-number,</m>   i.e., 
    <me>
      f-number = \frac{f}{D}
    </me>
        which describes the diameter of the aperture. A lower <m>f-number</m> relates to a wider aperture, 
        while a higher <m>f-number</m> means a narrower aperture. The diameters of the stop is marked 
        in such a way that each stop double the exposure time [<xref ref="fig74"/>]. if 1 second is exposure time for f-1, 
        then it would be 2 seconds for f-1.4, 4 seconds for f-2, 8 second for f-2.8, and so on. 
        Moving  from f/2.8 to f/4 is a decrease of 1 stop because <m>4 = 2.8 \times \sqrt{2}</m>, 
        going from f/16 to f/11 is an increase of 1 stop because <m>11 = 16 / \sqrt{2}</m>. In general, 
        f-numbers are assigned as shown in <xref ref="fnumbergr"/>. 
        The squares of the f-numbers are in the ratio of <m>1:2:4:8:16,</m> and so on.

  <title>Optical Vision</title>
 <introduction>
  <p>
    Eye is an optical device endowed to us to perceive the beautiful nature. It is nearly spherical 
    in shape of diameter about 2.3 cm. The front portion of eye is slightly bulges out and is 
    covered with transparent tough membrane called <em>cornea</em>. Behind cornea  it has liquid 
    called <em>aqueous humor</em>. Next to it is a diaphragm called <em>iris</em> with a hole at 
    its center called <em>pupi</em>l. Behind iris there is a crystalline lens which is mounted on 
    a <em>ciliary muscles</em>.  Inside eye ball is filled with liquid called <em>vitreous humor</em>. 
    The image is formed on the innermost light sensitive membrane called <em>retina</em>. 
    The pupil is just like a shutter in camera which allow the sufficient amount of light 
    to enter into the eye. The pupil takes sometime to readjust its size to allow how much 
    light permits to enter the eye,  this is the reason when you go from sunny day outside 
    to the relatively dark room like cinema hall nothing is visible  for a while but gradually 
    everything becomes clear after sometime. 
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="eye">
    <caption></caption>
    <image source="eye.png" width="55%"/>
</figure>
  <p>
    Once the light from objects falls on the retina after getting refracted from the crystalline 
    lens and vitrous humor, retina changes the light signal into electrical signal and transmits 
    this signal to the brain via optic nerve where brain realizes the image of the object. 
    The eye lens is designed in such a way that it forms the image of object situated at 
    different distances from the eye. The mechanism of crystalline lens to focus the light 
    coming from  objects at different distance to the retina is called an <term>accommodation</term>. 
    When object is near to the eye its focal length has to be smaller and lens has to be thicker 
    to focus the light on retina and when an object is very far away from the eye lens, 
    then its focal length has to be longer and lens has to be thinner to focus the light onto retina.

    A healthy human eye can see objects clearly  as close as 25 cm from  the eye. 
    This distance is called a least distance of distinct vision, D and the point is 
    called a <term>near point</term> N as shown in <xref ref="eyeaccn"/>.  
    A far point for healthy human eye is considered at infinity as shown in <xref ref="eyeaccf"/>. 
    If there exists any problem in the accommodation process, then the eyes are called 
    suffering from defects of vision. For example, if the ciliary muscles do not contract or 
    stretch as it supposed to be then our eye unable to focus the light at retina to 
    privide clear vision. There are many other reasons which may be responsible for defects of vision. 
    The common two types of defects of vision, myopia (short sightedness) and 
    hypermetropia (far sightedness) are being discussed here.
  </p>
 </introduction>

 <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-myopia">
  <title>Myopia:</title>
  <p>
    In this defect, objects far from eye appear blurred and that near eye appears clear. 
    When objects lie near eye eyelens can contract to become thicker and  achieve shorter 
    focal length to produce image of near objects at retina and hence objects appeared clear. 
    When objects are  far from eye eyelens cannot stretch to become sufficiently thinner and 
    achieve longer focal length to produce image of such objects on retina and hence it forms 
    image in front of retina as shown in <xref ref="myopia"/>. Actually, when objects lie anywhere 
    between new far point F and near point N, eye can accommodate itself for clear vision 
    but produces image in front of retina to any objects farther than point F. 
    To correct myopic eye a concave lens of suitable focal length can be used as shown in <xref ref="myopia2"/>.

    A suitable concave lens diverges the incoming light rays from the object at infinity in such 
    a way that the eyelens converges them to the retina. Hence a virtual image of the object is 
    formed at new far point. Here <m>s=\infty</m> and from lens formula the focal length of concave lens is given as 
    <me>
      \frac{1}{s}+\frac{1}{s'} =\frac{1}{f}

    The power of a lens is defined as

     and its SI unit is diopter (D).

 <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-hyperopia">
  <title>Hypermetropia  (or hyperopia):</title>
  <p>
    In this defect, objects far from eye appear clear and that near eye appears blurred. 
    When objects are  far from eye eyelens can stretch enough to become sufficiently thinner 
    and achieve longer focal length to produce image on retina. When objects lie near eye eyelens 
    cannot contract enough to become thicker and  achieve shorter focal length to produce image 
    at retina and hence the image is formed behind the retina as shown in <xref ref="hyperopia"/>. 
    Actually, when objects lie anywhere between infinity to new near point N' eye can accommodate 
    itself for clear vision but produces image behind the retina to any objects near than 
    point N'. To correct myopic eye a convex lens of suitable focal length can be used as shown in <xref ref="hyperopia2"/>.

    A suitable convex lens converges the incoming light rays from the object at near point N 
    in such a way that the eyelens converges  them further to the retina. Hence a virtual 
    image of the object is formed at new near point N'. Here <m>s=D </m> and from lens

 <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-visangle">
  <title>Visual Angle</title>
  <p>
    Angle subtended by an object on the eye is known as visual angle. 
    The size of the image formed at retina is proportional to the visual angle. 
    Higher the visual angle larger the apparent size of the object. Consider objects 
    <m>O_{1}</m> and <m>O_{2}</m> of different sizes are situated at different distance 
    from the eye but they subtend the same visual angle, <m>\theta_{1}</m> then size of 
    their images formed on the retina will be equal.  Hence they appeared to be of same size.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="visualang">
    <caption></caption>
    <image source="visualang.png" width="55%"/>
</figure>
<p>
  On the other hand, suppose two objects <m>O_{2}</m> and <m>O_{3}</m> of the same size 
  situated at different distances from the eye, but the object <m>O_{2}</m> subtends the 
  visual angle <m>\theta_{1}</m> and the object <m>O_{3}</m> subtends the visual angle 
  <m>\theta_{2} </m> such that <m>\theta_{2} \gt \theta_{1}</m> then the apparent size of 
  <m>O_{3}</m> looks larger then that of the object <m>O_{2}</m>. 
 </p>
 <p>
  If a is the distance of retina from the eye lens and b is the size of image on retina, 
  then from <xref ref="visualang"/>, we have - 
  <me>
    \frac{b}{a} = \theta,
  </me>
  <me>
    \text{or,}\quad b=a\theta
  </me>
  <me>
    \therefore\quad b \propto\theta
  </me>
  Since the diameter of eye ball, a is constant for a given eye.  Optical instruments are 
  used to increase the visual angle to observe objects clearly. 
 </p>
 </subsubsection>

 <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-magpower">
  <title>Angular Magnification  (or Magnifying Power:)</title>
  <p>
    Optical instruments such as microscope and telescope are designed to increase the 
    visual angle so that the object viewed through them can be made to appear larger 
    than its original size. Therefore the angular magnification, M of an instrument is 
    the ratio of the visual anlge subtended by the final image at the eye to the visual 
    angle subtended by the object itself at the eye without the use of instrument. 
    Suppose <m>\alpha</m> is the visual angle subtends by the object on eye when viewed 
    directly without the aid of an optical instrument and <m>\beta</m> is the angle subtends 
    by the final image of the object on eye when viewed with the help of the instrument, 
    then 
    <me>
      M=\frac{\beta}{\alpha}.
    </me>
     </p>
  <p>
    There are two positions in optical instruments where final image has been produced to observe. 
    When the final image is produced at the position where it is expected to see clearly is 
    called <term>normal adjustment</term>. For a simple or compound microscope normal adjustment is the position 
    when final image is formed at the least distance of distinct vision but for telescope 
    normal adjustment is the position of obtaining the final image at infinity. For the object 
    which is at a far distance and very small we want to see its big image and hence telescope 
    is set normally to see the final image at infinity. For the object which is near but extremely 
    small we want to see it very distinctly and highly resolved hence microscope is used to form the 
    final image of objects at our near point of clear vision which is about 25 cm from eye.

      A magnifying glass or a hand lens is called a simple microscope. It is a convex lens of short 
      focal length. When an object is placed between F and optical center C of the lens  its virtual

      an angle <m>\alpha</m> on eye when it is at a least distance of distinct vision, D so that

      Angular magnification of microscope, <me>M\propto f </me>, 
      so we can increase the magnification by reducing the focal length of the lens but there

      and has high focal length and large aperture. The lens near the object is called an <term>objective</term>

      Astronomical telescope is used to see celestial objects. It consists of two convex lenses 
      one which faces the object is called objective and another is near the eye called eyepiece. 
      Objective has large aperture (to collect sufficient amount of light to produce clear image) 
      and has large focal length. The eyepice has small aperture (to match the size of eye) and short focal length.

            In this case real image A'B' of the object at infinity is obtained at the focal plane of the objective. 
            The eyepiece is so adjusted that this image behaves like a real object of eyepiece situated at its

      Terra is a Latin name for earth. Telescope used to see the distant object clearly on earth is 
      called terrestrial telescope. It consists of three convex lenses. The lens between eyepiece 
      and objective is called an erecting lens. Heavenly objects are spherical in nature so the 
      inverted image does not affect viewers perception about the object but it is necessary to 
      have erect image of terrestrial objects to have their complete knowledge.

  <title>Photometry</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The branch of optics which deals with the measurement of light energy is called photometry. 
      Light is either reflected by the object or is emitted by it. Most of the objects are seen 
      when it reflects light, such as wall, book, moon, etc. Objects like lamp, stars, sun, etc. 
      can be seen when it emits its own light. To protect eye from light strain, some standard of 
      illumination must be set. Hence, it is necessary to measure the quantity of light emitted by a 
      source as well as the amount of light reflecting from some surface. The classroom illumination 
      of 250  lumens per square meter (or, lux) should be preferable, whereas operation theater 
      should be preferable to about 1000 lumens per square meter (or, lux).

    <title>Standard Candle</title>
    <p>
      A standard candle is made out of sperm wax weighing 1/6 pound, 7/8 inch in diameter, 
      4.5 cm in height, and it burns at the rate of 120 grains per hour. It was taken as a 
      standard unit of illuminating power of a source in early days. If the source gives off 
      light 60 times as the light given out by a standard candle then its power is taken as 60 candle power. 
      However, such measurement cannot be used in scientific work as the power of candle depends on 
      the shape of wick, size of flame during different seasons.  With the advancement in science 
      standard of light has been defined in terms of blackbody radiation. International unit of 
      Luminous intensity (or, Illuminating power) of source is taken as candela. One candela is 1/60 
      of the light luminosity coming out of a hole of area <m>1 \,cm^{2}</m> of a hollow cavity acting 
      as a black body radiator maintained at the freezing point (<m>1773\,^{o}C</m>) of platinum.
