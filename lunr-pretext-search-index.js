  "body": " General physics is a calculus-based introductory physics book. This book is a concise form of my lecture notes that I have been delivering in my introductory level courses for many years. This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the instructor but is designed to support calculus-based physics materials at a rapid and an efficient way in my personal teaching activities. Students who want to use this text assume to have prerequisite knowledge of some basic mathematical skills such as geometry, algebra, trigonometry, and some advanced mathematical tools such as a differential and integral calculus.  Learning skills by memorization cannot seem to be working efficiently in learning physics. Physics is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different approach than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into two volumes that covers the syllabus of introductory physics at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. General Physics I contains Basics of Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics.  General Physics II contains Electricity, Magnetism, Waves, Acoustics, and Optics. These topics have been carefully chosen to provide an introduction to the basic concepts in physics and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to learn how to investigate and approach problems in a logical manner. This book strives to guide readers to learn physics in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition.  To tackle the physical problems the book uses the 'GUESS' policy for a systematic gatheing of information and finding realistic and logistic solution. Here is what GUESS stands for   G: Given, identify the given information and sketch the information if possible.   U: Unknown, identify the unknown that we are looking for.   E: Equation\/s, set up the equation from given information.   S: Substitute, substitute the number\/s in the equation\/s.   S: Solve, solve the equation to obtain the answer.  Comments and suggestions for improvements to the text will be gratefully accepted -- Author   "

  "title": "Methods of Transferring Charges:",
  "body": " Methods of Transferring Charges:   Charge can neither be created nor be destroyed but it can be transferred from one object to another by the following processes.   Charging by Friction: In this method two neutral objects are rubbed together against each other to transfer charges from one object to another. The object which gains electrons becomes negatively charged and the one which looses electrons becomes positively charged.   Charging by Conduction: In this method charged object are brought in contact to the other object to transfer charges. Uncharged object becomes charged after touching by the charged object. When oppositely charged object brought in contact with each other they lose their charges.   Charging by Induction: In this method an uncharged object is brought near a charged object (no physical contact) to induce a positive and negative charge on it. When charged object is in proximity of uncharged object it produces an electrical force on electrons to move them from one part of object to another. When an insulator is brought near a charged object electrons of insulator atoms experience electrical force which stretches atoms to displace center of gravity of positive charges and negative charges. This phenomenon of separation of charges is called polarization . Hence in induction positive charges are separated from negative charges to produce charges on an object.      Electrophorus:                   It is a device used to produce charges using electrostatic induction. It consists of an insulating base plate and a conducting disc (also known as electrophorus disc) with an insulated handle [ ]. At first insulating plate is rubbed with silk, fur, or wool which produces charges on the plate depending on the type of materials being rubbed together. In the figure above negative charges are produced on the base plate. Electrophorus disk is then brought in contact with this plate and then grounded. Grounding help free charges on disk to neutralize with the opposite charges from the earth (ground). Earth is an infinite source of charges and because electrons are lighter than the positive charges electrons can easily come from earth to the disk to neutralize free positive charges or they can leave the disc to the ground if they are free charges. After grounding, the disk contains only one kind of charges, it is then disconnected from ground before get removed from the plate. All the charges on the disk then spread around its surface which can be stored and used as needed. In this case positive charges are stored from the disk.    Electroscope:      It is an instrument used to detect charge on a body. It consists of two gold (or silver or aluminum) leaves suspended from a conducting rod that leads to the outside of an insulating glass container ( ). The rod has metallic ball attached at its top, when a charged object is brought near the conducting ball or make in contact with it causes the leaves to diverge because like charges repel each other. The nature of charge (positive or negative) on any object can also be determined with the help of electroscope, by making its leaves charged with the known charges.   "

The direction of force is always acting along the line joining these two point charges. If is a force acting on charge due to charge  is a force acting on charge due to charge and is a distance between the two charges ( ) then from Coulumb's law where is unit vector along line joining the two charges, Coulomb's constant of free space, ; and permittivity of free space,  Permittivity is an ability of a medium to store electrical energy in an electric field. In other words, permittivity is the extent to which a medium permits electrical lines of force between the charges. It is a resistance of a medium in forming electric fields. It describes the effect of a material in an electrical field. The higher the permittivity, the more the material tends to reduce electrical field (due to polarization) that set up it.                 Coulumb's Law in One Dimension  Coulomb's law holds good only for two point charges but if more than two charges are located in space then the force on each of them can be determined by using the principle of superposition.    Coulomb's Law in Two and Three Dimensions  Use principle of superposition to obtain force on any charge if the charges are distributed at different points in space.   "

  "title": "Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution",
  "body": " Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution   Coulomb's law only work for two point charges, if we are dealing with more than two discrete charges then we have to use principle of superposition to find the field at a point using Coulomb's law. Most often charges are distributed on the material in such a rigourous way that applying Coulomb's low is very difficult, e.g. charges are distributed on a sphere, a plane surface, a rod or on some weird surface like pyramid. In that case it would be easier to find an electric field at point by breaking the charge distribution in small elements and treat them like a point charge. Write the equation of electric field for one single element of the charge and integrate them for the entire charge. In order to break these charge distribution in small elements we need to discuss charge density.   Charge Density: Depend upon the surface where charges are distributed uniformly we can have three different types of charge density.   Linear charge density, : If the charges are distributed uniformly in a linear shape then the charge density is called a linear charge density. It is defined as the amount of charge per unit length. Let say the charge Q be distributed smoothly on a wire of length L, then It's unit is Now if a small length contains a charge then    Surface charge density, If the charges are distributed uniformly on a surface area then the charge density is called a surface charge density. It is defined as the amount of charge per unit area. Let say the charge Q be distributed smoothly on a plane of area A, then It's unit is Now if a small area of that surface contains a charge then    Volume charge density, If the charges are distributed uniformly in a volume of any material then the charge density is called a volume charge density.

Hence Coulomb's law can not be applied to determined field at a point for a finite charged conductor.               Consider a symmterical cylindrical Gaussian surface around the charge on an infinitly charged wire of linear charge density is as shown in . Now electric flux, through the surfaces and is given by   From Gauss's law  is the charge enclosed in the Gaussian surface. Hence,  ie., Electric field is inversely proportional to distance of the point from a charged rod [ ].    Electric field due to a uniform infinite cylindrical charge  Consider an infinitely long cylinder of radius R on which electric charge is distributed uniformly. If is charge per unit length and is a volume charge density then          Electric field at any point [ ] outside the cylindrical charge distribution i.e., : Consider a Gaussian surface of radius and length symmetric to the charge distribution. Due to symmetry the field is everywhere normal to the curved surface and has the same magnitude at all points of it. There is no contribution in fluxes due to flat bases of the Gaussian surface as is parallel to them. Hence    Thus the electric field at outside of a uniform infinite cylindrical charge distribution is same as that due to infinite line charge.  Electric field at the point [ ] on the surface of cylindrical charge distribution i.e.,     Electric field at the point [ ] inside the cylindrical charge distribution i.e.,   Thus the electric field inside the cylindrical charge distribution is proportional to the distance of the point from the axis and is directed radially away from the axis. The variation of field with distance from the axis of a cylindrical charge is shown in .      Electric field due to infinite sheet of charge      Consider a symmetrical cylindrical Gaussian surface around the charge on an infinitely charged sheet of surface charge density is as shown in . Now electric flux, through the surfaces and is given by    But from Gauss's law,   Now because of surface symmetry around the charge  That is, field is independent upon the distance of the point as long as the point is not significantly far away. Electric field is normal to the charged sheet except at the edges where it is emitting radially out ward in all possible directions. Hence, Gaussian law can not be applied to determined field at a point for a finite charged conductor.    Electric field just outside a charged conductor  Consider a conductor of any shape AB has given a charge q. This charge will redistribute under electrostatic equilibrium on a conductor in such a way that the field inside the conductor is zero i.e., Now consider a point P just outside of the conductor and be the surface charge density of the conductor.      Now consider a small cylindrical Gaussian surface CD having the base C passing through P, the other side D lying inside the conductor and the curved surface being perpendicular to the surface of the conductor. The flux through the curved surface is zero since there is no component of electric field normal to the curved surface. Also the flux through the base D is zero as electric field inside the conductor is zero. Therefore the resultant flux of the entire surface of the Gaussian cylinder is the same as the flux through the face C which is equal to     Thus the electric field at any point close to the surface of a charged conductor of any shape is equal to times the surface charge density . If is positive, electric field is directed away from the conductor and if it is negative, then field is directed towards the conductor. Obviously field near a plane conductor is twice of the field in front of a non-conducting thin sheet of charge.   "

Prove that any excess charge on a solid conductor must reside on the outside surface of the conductor.  Prove that if a hollow conductor surrounds a charge q, an equal but opposite charge -q resides on the inside surface of the conductor and all excess charge on the outside surface.        In the electrostatic case, charges do not move. Therefore, the charge carriers inside a conductor cannot experience an electrical force. Therefore, the electric field must be zero.    Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, the flux through a Gaussian surface inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the total charge inside the Gaussian surface must be zero. If the Gaussian surface is constructed immediately below the surface of the conductor, the charge inside the surface must still be zero. Since the charge on a conductor cannot reside inside the surface of the conductor, it must reside on the surface.    Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, the flux through a Gaussian surface inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the total charge inside the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore the combined charge inside the hole and on the inner surface of the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the inner surface of the conductor must contain a charge equal and opposite to the charge surrounded by the conductor. Therefore, any remaining charge must reside on the outer surface of the conductor.          A charge q is placed at the center of a cylinder of radius R and length l.

If the electric field at the surface of a conductor has a component parallel to the surface, the charges on the surface will move in that direction. Since they do not move in the electrostatic situation, the electric field must be everywhere perpendicular to the surface of the conductor.    Pick a Gaussian surface surrounding a small enough region of the conductor's surface so the charge density is constant. Let be the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface and the area of the surface of the conductor enclosed by the Gaussian surface. Then the charge per unit area of the conductor in that region of space is     Because is constant in this small region of space, due to symmetry the electric field must be perpendicular to the surface of the conductor and constant at a distance d from the surface.

  "title": "Capacitors",
  "body": " Capacitors       In any electronic circuit we can see some of these types of devices [ ]. They are known as condenser or capacitor .   Capacitor: It is a charge storing device. It can store electrical energy in the form of electrical charge that produces potential difference across its plates. Since we can also store charge on a conductor it can also be considered as capacitor but it can store a very limited amount of charge for a short duration only. A capacity of storing charge on a conductor can be increased by arranging two or more parallel conducting surfaces that are placed close to each other with insulating material\/s between them, e.g. air and\/or any dielectrics. If these surfaces are plane we call it a parallel plate capacitor, if they are cylindrical it is a cylindrical capacitor, and if they are spherical it is a spherical capacitor.                Capacitance: The capacity of storing charge on a capacitor is termed as capacitance. when an isolated conductor is given a charge it acquires a certain potential. If is found that the potential V acquired by the conductor is proportional to the charge Q given to it i.e.   Here C is a proportionality constant known as capacitance of that conductor (or capacitor). Hence capacitance is defined as the charge required to raise the potential of the conductor by unity. Its unit is Farad . If one coulomb of charge stored in a capacitor of potential difference across the plates is one volt then its capacitance is one Farad. Farad is a very large number. The entire earth as a spherical capacitor has a capacitance of only 0.0007 Farad.  The increase of capacitance of a conductor can be understood by the following arrangement. Let A be an isolated conductor which is charged to a maximum potential V volts. [ Note: Potential refers to a potential difference of a conductor with respect to ground.]  Suppose we want to store some more charge on it then we have to reduce its potential somehow before putting any charge. So another isolated conductor B is brought near A then A induces negative charges on the inner surface of B and positive charges on the outer surface as shown in . The negative charge on B tends to reduce the potential of A and positive charge on B tends to increase potential of A. Since negative charges of B are closer to A than the positive charges of B the net potential of A is reduced by some amount. This slight decrees in potential of A results increase of capacitance of A because of relation remaining Q constant. Hence a more charge can be stored on the same conductor till the potential again reaches to V. The capacitance can be considerably high if the conductors are placed very close to each other and a conductor B is grounded ( ). The relation explains that the increase in permitivity of the dielectric medium between conducting plates also increases the capacitance.   Absolute Permittivity, : [ ] It is a permittivity of a medium and defines how difficult it is for a medium to form an electric field.     Combination of Capacitors  The two or more than two capacitors can be grouped in an electrical circuit to achieve certain task. These group may be series or parallel or in combination of both.                      Series Combination of Capacitors When capacitors are connected in such a way that same charge is seemed to be passing through each capacitor then the combination is called a series combination of capacitors. In this case positive terminal of one capacitor is connected to the negative terminal of another capacitor as shown in . If charge Q is sent in the circuit by a battery of emf, V [ ], then  Now replace these capacitors with such a single capacitor that draws a same amount of charge Q from the same battery as shown in , then this new capacitor is called an equivalent capacitor of all these previous capacitors in series. Hence, from eqns. and , we get -    Parallel Combination of Capacitors When capacitors are connected in such a way that charges are distributed among capacitors then the combination is called a parallel combination of capacitors. In this case similar terminals of capacitors are connected together as shown in . If q is the charge sent in the circuit by a battery of emf, V then  Now if these capacitors are replaced by a single capacitor, such that circuit draws the same amount of charge from the same battery ( ), then Hence from eqns. and , we get -       Parallel-Plate Capacitor  A parallel plate capacitor [ ] consists of two metal plates of large surface area placed close to each other parallely with one of the plates grounded. Let be the surface area of the plates and they are separated by a distance apart. If surface charge density of the plates are and space between the plates is filled with dielectric of permittivity Then the electric field between the plates is given by   pointed along -ve plate.  where is the potential difference between the plates and the angle between and is  If the space between the plates is filled with dielectric with permitivity then capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by        Dielectric constant, (or Relative Permitivity, ): It is a measure of insulating ability of a medium. It is a ratio of the permitivity of the medium to the permitivity of a free space i.e., It is an ability of a medium to store electrical energy in presence of electric field.     Spherical Capacitor  A spherical capacitor consists of two concentric conducting spherical shells [ ] of inner radius and outer radius such that and space between them is filled with dielectric of permittivity . If a charge is given to the inner shell then amount of charge is induced on the inner surface of outer shell and charge on the outer surface of outer shell. As the outer surface is grounded charge neutralizes with the negative charge coming from the earth. Now using Gauss's law the electric field at any point between the shells is given        where is the radius of Gaussian surface and is the charge enclosed by it. The potential difference between the shells is then,   Hence the capacitance of the spherical capacitor is given by If , then Which is the capacitance of an isolated spherical conductor of radius .    Cylindrical Capacitor      A cylindrical capacitor consists of two concentric conducting cylindrical shells of inner radius and outer radius [ ] such that and space between them is filled with dielectric of permittivity . If a charge is given to the inner shell then the charge is induced on the inner surface of outer shell and charge on the outer surface of outer shell. As the outer cylinder is grounded charge neutralizes with the negative charge coming from the earth. Now using Gauss's law the electric field at any point between the shells is given by  where is the radius of Gaussian surface and is the surface charge density of the inner cylinder. The potential difference between the shells is then,   Hence the capacitance of the cylindrical capacitor of length is given by    "
