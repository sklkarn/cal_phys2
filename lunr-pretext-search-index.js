  "body": " General physics is a calculus-based introductory physics book. This book is a concise form of my lecture notes that I have been delivering in my introductory level courses for many years. This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the instructor but is designed to support calculus-based physics materials at a rapid and an efficient way in my personal teaching activities. Students who want to use this text assume to have prerequisite knowledge of some basic mathematical skills such as geometry, algebra, trigonometry, and some advanced mathematical tools such as a differential and integral calculus.  Learning skills by memorization cannot seem to be working efficiently in learning physics. Physics is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different approach than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into two volumes that covers the syllabus of introductory physics at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. General Physics I contains Basics of Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics.  General Physics II contains Electricity, Magnetism, Waves, Acoustics, and Optics. These topics have been carefully chosen to provide an introduction to the basic concepts in physics and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to learn how to investigate and approach problems in a logical manner. This book strives to guide readers to learn physics in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition.  To tackle the physical problems the book uses the 'GUESS' policy for a systematic gatheing of information and finding realistic and logistic solution. Here is what GUESS stands for   G: Given, identify the given information and sketch the information if possible.   U: Unknown, identify the unknown that we are looking for.   E: Equation\/s, set up the equation from given information.   S: Substitute, substitute the number\/s in the equation\/s.   S: Solve, solve the equation to obtain the answer.  Comments and suggestions for improvements to the text will be gratefully accepted -- Author   "

  "title": "Methods of Transferring Charges:",
  "body": " Methods of Transferring Charges:   Charge can neither be created nor be destroyed but it can be transferred from one object to another by the following processes.   Charging by Friction: In this method two neutral objects are rubbed together against each other to transfer charges from one object to another. The object which gains electrons becomes negatively charged and the one which looses electrons becomes positively charged.   Charging by Conduction: In this method charged object are brought in contact to the other object to transfer charges. Uncharged object becomes charged after touching by the charged object. When oppositely charged object brought in contact with each other they lose their charges.   Charging by Induction: In this method an uncharged object is brought near a charged object (no physical contact) to induce a positive and negative charge on it. When charged object is in proximity of uncharged object it produces an electrical force on electrons to move them from one part of object to another. When an insulator is brought near a charged object electrons of insulator atoms experience electrical force which stretches atoms to displace center of gravity of positive charges and negative charges. This phenomenon of separation of charges is called polarization . Hence in induction positive charges are separated from negative charges to produce charges on an object.      Electrophorus:                   It is a device used to produce charges using electrostatic induction. It consists of an insulating base plate and a conducting disc (also known as electrophorus disc) with an insulated handle [ ]. At first insulating plate is rubbed with silk, fur, or wool which produces charges on the plate depending on the type of materials being rubbed together. In the figure above negative charges are produced on the base plate. Electrophorus disk is then brought in contact with this plate and then grounded. Grounding help free charges on disk to neutralize with the opposite charges from the earth (ground). Earth is an infinite source of charges and because electrons are lighter than the positive charges electrons can easily come from earth to the disk to neutralize free positive charges or they can leave the disc to the ground if they are free charges. After grounding, the disk contains only one kind of charges, it is then disconnected from ground before get removed from the plate. All the charges on the disk then spread around its surface which can be stored and used as needed. In this case positive charges are stored from the disk.    Electroscope:      It is an instrument used to detect charge on a body. It consists of two gold (or silver or aluminum) leaves suspended from a conducting rod that leads to the outside of an insulating glass container ( ). The rod has metallic ball attached at its top, when a charged object is brought near the conducting ball or make in contact with it causes the leaves to diverge because like charges repel each other. The nature of charge (positive or negative) on any object can also be determined with the help of electroscope, by making its leaves charged with the known charges.   "

The direction of force is always acting along the line joining these two point charges. If is a force acting on charge due to charge  is a force acting on charge due to charge and is a distance between the two charges ( ) then from Coulumb's law where is unit vector along line joining the two charges, Coulomb's constant of free space, ; and permittivity of free space,  Permittivity is an ability of a medium to store electrical energy in an electric field. In other words, permittivity is the extent to which a medium permits electrical lines of force between the charges. It is a resistance of a medium in forming electric fields. It describes the effect of a material in an electrical field. The higher the permittivity, the more the material tends to reduce electrical field (due to polarization) that set up it.                 Coulumb's Law in One Dimension  Coulomb's law holds good only for two point charges but if more than two charges are located in space then the force on each of them can be determined by using the principle of superposition.    Coulomb's Law in Two and Three Dimensions  Use principle of superposition to obtain force on any charge if the charges are distributed at different points in space.   "

  "title": "Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution",
  "body": " Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution  Coulomb's law only work for two point charges, if we are dealing with more than two discrete charges then we have to use principle of superposition to find the field at a point using Coulomb's law. Most often charges are distributed on the material in such a rigourous way that applying Coulomb's low is very difficult, e.g. charges are distributed on a sphere, a plane surface, a rod or on some weird surface like pyramid. In that case it would be easier to find an electric field at point by breaking the charge distribution in small elements and treat them like a point charge. Write the equation of electric field for one single element of the charge and integrate them for the entire charge. In order to break these charge distribution in small elements we need to discuss charge density.   Charge Density: Depend upon the surface where charges are distributed uniformly we can have three different types of charge density.   Linear charge density, : If the charges are distributed uniformly in a linear shape then the charge density is called a linear charge density. It is defined as the amount of charge per unit length. Let say the charge Q be distributed smoothly on a wire of length L, then It's unit is Now if a small length contains a charge then    Surface charge density, If the charges are distributed uniformly on a surface area then the charge density is called a surface charge density. It is defined as the amount of charge per unit area. Let say the charge Q be distributed smoothly on a plane of area A, then It's unit is Now if a small area of that surface contains a charge then    Volume charge density, If the charges are distributed uniformly in a volume of any material then the charge density is called a volume charge density.

Hence Coulomb's law can not be applied to determined field at a point for a finite charged conductor.               Consider a symmterical cylindrical Gaussian surface around the charge on an infinitly charged wire of linear charge density is as shown in . Now electric flux, through the surfaces and is given by   From Gauss's law  is the charge enclosed in the Gaussian surface. Hence,  ie., Electric field is inversely proportional to distance of the point from a charged rod [ ].    Electric field due to a uniform infinite cylindrical charge  Consider an infinitely long cylinder of radius R on which electric charge is distributed uniformly. If is charge per unit length and is a volume charge density then          Electric field at any point [ ] outside the cylindrical charge distribution i.e., : Consider a Gaussian surface of radius and length symmetric to the charge distribution. Due to symmetry the field is everywhere normal to the curved surface and has the same magnitude at all points of it. There is no contribution in fluxes due to flat bases of the Gaussian surface as is parallel to them. Hence    Thus the electric field at outside of a uniform infinite cylindrical charge distribution is same as that due to infinite line charge.  Electric field at the point [ ] on the surface of cylindrical charge distribution i.e.,     Electric field at the point [ ] inside the cylindrical charge distribution i.e.,   Thus the electric field inside the cylindrical charge distribution is proportional to the distance of the point from the axis and is directed radially away from the axis. The variation of field with distance from the axis of a cylindrical charge is shown in .      Electric field due to infinite sheet of charge      Consider a symmetrical cylindrical Gaussian surface around the charge on an infinitely charged sheet of surface charge density is as shown in . Now electric flux, through the surfaces and is given by    But from Gauss's law,   Now because of surface symmetry around the charge  That is, field is independent upon the distance of the point as long as the point is not significantly far away. Electric field is normal to the charged sheet except at the edges where it is emitting radially out ward in all possible directions. Hence, Gaussian law can not be applied to determined field at a point for a finite charged conductor.    Electric field just outside a charged conductor  Consider a conductor of any shape AB has given a charge q. This charge will redistribute under electrostatic equilibrium on a conductor in such a way that the field inside the conductor is zero i.e., Now consider a point P just outside of the conductor and be the surface charge density of the conductor.      Now consider a small cylindrical Gaussian surface CD having the base C passing through P, the other side D lying inside the conductor and the curved surface being perpendicular to the surface of the conductor. The flux through the curved surface is zero since there is no component of electric field normal to the curved surface. Also the flux through the base D is zero as electric field inside the conductor is zero. Therefore the resultant flux of the entire surface of the Gaussian cylinder is the same as the flux through the face C which is equal to     Thus the electric field at any point close to the surface of a charged conductor of any shape is equal to times the surface charge density . If is positive, electric field is directed away from the conductor and if it is negative, then field is directed towards the conductor. Obviously field near a plane conductor is twice of the field in front of a non-conducting thin sheet of charge.   "

Prove that any excess charge on a solid conductor must reside on the outside surface of the conductor.  Prove that if a hollow conductor surrounds a charge q, an equal but opposite charge -q resides on the inside surface of the conductor and all excess charge on the outside surface.        In the electrostatic case, charges do not move. Therefore, the charge carriers inside a conductor cannot experience an electrical force. Therefore, the electric field must be zero.    Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, the flux through a Gaussian surface inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the total charge inside the Gaussian surface must be zero. If the Gaussian surface is constructed immediately below the surface of the conductor, the charge inside the surface must still be zero. Since the charge on a conductor cannot reside inside the surface of the conductor, it must reside on the surface.    Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, the flux through a Gaussian surface inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the total charge inside the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore the combined charge inside the hole and on the inner surface of the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the inner surface of the conductor must contain a charge equal and opposite to the charge surrounded by the conductor. Therefore, any remaining charge must reside on the outer surface of the conductor.          A charge q is placed at the center of a cylinder of radius R and length l.

If the electric field at the surface of a conductor has a component parallel to the surface, the charges on the surface will move in that direction. Since they do not move in the electrostatic situation, the electric field must be everywhere perpendicular to the surface of the conductor.    Pick a Gaussian surface surrounding a small enough region of the conductor's surface so the charge density is constant. Let be the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface and the area of the surface of the conductor enclosed by the Gaussian surface. Then the charge per unit area of the conductor in that region of space is     Because is constant in this small region of space, due to symmetry the electric field must be perpendicular to the surface of the conductor and constant at a distance d from the surface.

  "title": "Capacitors",
  "body": " Capacitors       In any electronic circuit we can see some of these types of devices [ ]. They are known as condenser or capacitor .   Capacitor: It is a charge storing device. It can store electrical energy in the form of electrical charge that produces potential difference across its plates. Since we can also store charge on a conductor it can also be considered as capacitor but it can store a very limited amount of charge for a short duration only. A capacity of storing charge on a conductor can be increased by arranging two or more parallel conducting surfaces that are placed close to each other with insulating material\/s between them, e.g. air and\/or any dielectrics. If these surfaces are plane we call it a parallel plate capacitor, if they are cylindrical it is a cylindrical capacitor, and if they are spherical it is a spherical capacitor.                Capacitance: The capacity of storing charge on a capacitor is termed as capacitance. when an isolated conductor is given a charge it acquires a certain potential. If is found that the potential V acquired by the conductor is proportional to the charge Q given to it i.e.   Here C is a proportionality constant known as capacitance of that conductor (or capacitor). Hence capacitance is defined as the charge required to raise the potential of the conductor by unity. Its unit is Farad . If one coulomb of charge stored in a capacitor of potential difference across the plates is one volt then its capacitance is one Farad. Farad is a very large number. The entire earth as a spherical capacitor has a capacitance of only 0.0007 Farad.  The increase of capacitance of a conductor can be understood by the following arrangement. Let A be an isolated conductor which is charged to a maximum potential V volts. [ Note: Potential refers to a potential difference of a conductor with respect to ground.]  Suppose we want to store some more charge on it then we have to reduce its potential somehow before putting any charge. So another isolated conductor B is brought near A then A induces negative charges on the inner surface of B and positive charges on the outer surface as shown in . The negative charge on B tends to reduce the potential of A and positive charge on B tends to increase potential of A. Since negative charges of B are closer to A than the positive charges of B the net potential of A is reduced by some amount. This slight decrees in potential of A results increase of capacitance of A because of relation remaining Q constant. Hence a more charge can be stored on the same conductor till the potential again reaches to V. The capacitance can be considerably high if the conductors are placed very close to each other and a conductor B is grounded ( ). The relation explains that the increase in permitivity of the dielectric medium between conducting plates also increases the capacitance.   Absolute Permittivity, : [ ] It is a permittivity of a medium and defines how difficult it is for a medium to form an electric field.     Combination of Capacitors  The two or more than two capacitors can be grouped in an electrical circuit to achieve certain task. These group may be series or parallel or in combination of both.                      Series Combination of Capacitors When capacitors are connected in such a way that same charge is seemed to be passing through each capacitor then the combination is called a series combination of capacitors. In this case positive terminal of one capacitor is connected to the negative terminal of another capacitor as shown in . If charge Q is sent in the circuit by a battery of emf, V [ ], then  Now replace these capacitors with such a single capacitor that draws a same amount of charge Q from the same battery as shown in , then this new capacitor is called an equivalent capacitor of all these previous capacitors in series. Hence, from eqns. and , we get -    Parallel Combination of Capacitors When capacitors are connected in such a way that charges are distributed among capacitors then the combination is called a parallel combination of capacitors. In this case similar terminals of capacitors are connected together as shown in . If q is the charge sent in the circuit by a battery of emf, V then  Now if these capacitors are replaced by a single capacitor, such that circuit draws the same amount of charge from the same battery ( ), then Hence from eqns. and , we get -       Parallel-Plate Capacitor  A parallel plate capacitor [ ] consists of two metal plates of large surface area placed close to each other parallely with one of the plates grounded. Let be the surface area of the plates and they are separated by a distance apart. If surface charge density of the plates are and space between the plates is filled with dielectric of permittivity Then the electric field between the plates is given by   pointed along -ve plate.  where is the potential difference between the plates and the angle between and is  If the space between the plates is filled with dielectric with permitivity then capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by        Dielectric constant, (or Relative Permitivity, ): It is a measure of insulating ability of a medium. It is a ratio of the permitivity of the medium to the permitivity of a free space i.e., It is an ability of a medium to store electrical energy in presence of electric field.     Spherical Capacitor  A spherical capacitor consists of two concentric conducting spherical shells [ ] of inner radius and outer radius such that and space between them is filled with dielectric of permittivity . If a charge is given to the inner shell then amount of charge is induced on the inner surface of outer shell and charge on the outer surface of outer shell. As the outer surface is grounded charge neutralizes with the negative charge coming from the earth. Now using Gauss's law the electric field at any point between the shells is given        where is the radius of Gaussian surface and is the charge enclosed by it. The potential difference between the shells is then,   Hence the capacitance of the spherical capacitor is given by If , then Which is the capacitance of an isolated spherical conductor of radius .    Cylindrical Capacitor      A cylindrical capacitor consists of two concentric conducting cylindrical shells of inner radius and outer radius [ ] such that and space between them is filled with dielectric of permittivity . If a charge is given to the inner shell then the charge is induced on the inner surface of outer shell and charge on the outer surface of outer shell. As the outer cylinder is grounded charge neutralizes with the negative charge coming from the earth. Now using Gauss's law the electric field at any point between the shells is given by  where is the radius of Gaussian surface and is the surface charge density of the inner cylinder. The potential difference between the shells is then,   Hence the capacitance of the cylindrical capacitor of length is given by    "

Usually , being resistance of the conductor. Hence      Resistivity or Specific Resistance, :  We know that if a conductor of length has a potential difference across its ends is then electric field can be given as [ ] and if current, is flowing in this conductor of area of cross-section , then current density is . Now using Ohm's law, we have In this expression resistance of the conductor of the given length and area of cross-section are all constant. Hence we can write electrical field as where is known as a specific resistance or resistivity of the conductor. It is a property of the material. Different material has a different resistivity. If a conductor of length has a cross-section area then i.e., resistivity of a conductor is a resistance of a unit length of the conductor of unit area cross-section. It's unit is  The reciprocal of resistivty is known as conductivity , Such expression allows us to compare electrical field with current density such as      Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity  The resistivity of a conductor varies with temperature such that where are resistivity at temperature and and are constants whose value depend on material. If temperature is not sufficiently large then higher order terms are neglected hence,  Here the constant is called temperature coefficient of resistivity of a conductor. It defines the material property. Now as resistance is proportional to the resistivity, we can write i.e., a resistance or resistivity of metallic conductors increases with temperature.

  "body": " A summary on internal resistance, emf, and terminal potential difference:                    To understand internal resistance and emf lets consider a lead-acid cell. However, the similar senario could be applied for any other alkaline cells. In lead - acid cell dilute has been used as an electrolyte which gets dissociated in ions and ions in aquous environment as shown in . Now ion migrates towards electrode, captures electron from the electrode and becomes nacent hydrogen atom. Nacent then reacts with and forms and . instantly reacts with molecule and converted into . As charges start accumulating on electrode, we call it a plate of the cell.  On the otherhand, ion attracts towards electrode, dumps its negative charges on it and becomes radical which instantly reacts with to form . In this case electrode starts accumulating charges and becomes a plate of the cell. This process continues till sufficient charges accumulate on these electrodes and it is difficult for the other ions to migrate towards these electrodes because of electrostatic repulsion between the same charges. When transferring of charges by the ions to their respective electrodes stop then electrode has accumated maximum positive charge and electrode has accumulated maximum negative charge. This condition builds up maximum potential difference between the electrodes which is known as electromottife force, emf . The name emf is misleading but it came from its founder, \" Alessandro Volta \" who had used this term as the real reason behind the motion of these charges in the external circuit was not known. The chemical reactions on the electrodes are summarized as follows.  At plate:  At plate:  Remember: Anode is the electrode where oxidation occurs and cathode is where reduction occurs. OILRIG:  O xydation I s L ossing of electron and R eduction I s G aining of electron.   If a load, R is applied between the electrodes then accumulated negative charges begin to flow from cathode to anode via load as shown in . Due to which other +ve and -ve ions again start migrating towards electrodes to perform chemical reaction. Hence accumulation of charges on the electrodes in a solution and discharging via load are continuous by maintaing the equilibrium condition. The voltage at this time between the electrodes is known as terminal voltage or terminal potential difference as shown in . The difference is called the lost voltage. Lost voltage is proportional to the current or disacharging rate of the electrodes. The straight line shows the ideal case of rate of accumulation of charges on the electrodes. The straight line shows the rate of discharging of electrodes or current through the load. If higher load is applied current decreases on the load depicting line in the graph. The projection of intersection point between rate of charging and rate of discharging on x axis gives the value of terminal potential difference (voltage). The terminal voltage increases with increasing load thus decreases the lost voltage on the internal resistance. Lost voltage occurs due to drop of voltage on internal resistance. See the equation above .   "

Lets calculate the maximum power transfer to the load. Consider a simple circuit as shown in . Now, power generated by the source is given by and power transfered to the load can be From Ohm's law, we have  Hence, from eqns. and we get-   That is, power transfer depends upon the load resistance.

  "title": "Magnetic Materials",
  "body": " Magnetic Materials   The orbital and spin motion of electrons or the interaction of one electron to the other is the origin of magnetism of any materials. Hence all most all materials display magnetic behaviors. On the basis of magnetic behaviors there are three types of materials. They are  Ferromagnetic,  Paramagnetic, and  Diamagnetic.  However, there are three other types of magnetic behaviors also found in nature they are ferrimagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and superparamagnetic which are not the part of discussion here.    Ferromagnetic Material:               It has a very strong magnetization. Magnetization is a physical process of being magnetized when a material is subjected to an external magnetic field. The atomic dipole moments are very strong in these type of materials. Most permanent magnets are ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium. Transition metals and some rare earth metals exhibits ferromagnetic behavior. Unpaired electrons spins in partially filled orbitals gives rise to a local magnetic moment. Actually, unpaired electrons containing atoms are very close to each other (and hence there is strong exchange interactions between them) which creates domains in the crystal structure that have the same direction supporting each other. In ferromagnetic materials magnetic dipoles are aligned in a specific direction in a small group within the materials called a domain . The direction of dipole moments vary from one domain to another which cancels the effect of one another and material does not show any intrinsic specific magnetic behavior. But as the material is exposed to an external magnetic field dipole moments of all domains aligned in the direction of external magnetic field and material behaves like a magnet. Once the dipoles aligned in one direction they retain in the same direction even after removal of external field. Hence the permanent magnets are made out of ferromagnetic materials. Bar magnet, horse shoe magnet, disc magnet, . are some examples of permanent magnets. is an electromagnet whose core is often made from ferromagnetic material.    Paramagnetic Material:  It has a week atomic dipole moment. Unpaired electrons in a partially filled orbitals give rise to a net magnetic moment of atoms but due to thermal agitation the resultant magnetic moment of the materials is zero and hence show no magnetic behavior on its own. Aluminum, magnesium, tungsten, and titanium are some examples of paramagnetic materials. Unpaired electrons in a paramagnetic material are relatively far away from each other hence the exchange interaction is very weak and can not creates any domain. The magnetic moments of such atoms are oriented in random direction and they cancel out each other effect. When subjected to an external magnetic field magnetic moment of the material however, align in a direction to the external filed and starts showing net magnetization. Again, magnetization becomes zero with the removal of external field.    Diamagnetic Material:  This type of materials are composed of atoms that do not possess any net magnetic moments i.e., all the orbitals of atoms are filled and there are no unpaired electrons. Bismuth, copper, lead, mercury, silver, gold, tin, diamond, water, and graphite are some examples of diamagnetic materials. However, when subject to an external field dipole moments induced in a material opposite to external field. Hence diamagnetic materials are deflected away from the magnetic field. The magnetization of such materials becomes zero after removal of external fields.   "

  "body": " Geomagnetism               Geomagnetism is the study of the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field, which is produced in the inner core. The Earth's magnetic field is predominantly a geo-axial dipole, with north and south magnetic poles located near the from the geographic poles that undergo periodic reversals and excursions. The Earth's magnetic field is attributed to a dynamo effect of circulating electric current, but it is not constant in direction. Rock specimens of different ages in similar locations have different directions of permanent magnetization. The circulating electric currents in the Earth's molten metallic core are the cause of the earth's magnetic field. Convection drives the outer-core fluid and it circulates relative to the earth. This means the electrically conducting material moves relative to the earth's magnetic field. If it can obtain a charge by some interaction like friction between layers, an effective current loop could be produced. The magnetic field of a current loop could sustain the magnetic dipole type field of the earth [ ]. The magnitude of magnetic field at the surface of the Earth is about half a Gauss and dips toward the Earth in the northern hemisphere. The magnitude varies over the surface of the Earth in the range 0.3 to 0.6 Gauss.     Magnetic Meridian: An imaginary vertical plane passing through the axis of a freely suspended magnet is called a magnetic meridian. The direction of Earth's magnetic field lies in the magnetic meridian may or may not be horizontal. The vertical plane passing through the geographical axis of Earth is called geographical meridian [ ]. The angle between the magnetic meridian and the geographic meridian at a place is called a magnetic declination, D at that place. At equator it is zero since field is parallel to the earth surface and is maximum at poles. The declination is expressed in degrees East or degrees West For example a declination of means the compass will point 2 degrees east of true geographical North. Thus, the knowledge of declination at a place helps in finding the true geographical directions at that place. The declination at point O is    Magnetic Inclination or magnetic dip is the angle (I) between the horizontal component of earth's magnetic field (H) and the total magnetic field vector Moving closer to magnetic poles results in one side of the compass needle pointing downwards. Between the magnetic poles there is an area called the magnetic equator where inclination or the magnetic dip angle is zero; the magnetic field vector does not have a vertical component in this area. To the north of the magnetic equator, the north end of the compass needle points downward, both I and H are positive. To the south of the magnetic equator, the south end of the needle points downward, that is I and H are both negative.    "

  "body": " Magnetic Flux,   The number of magnetic field lines passing through any surface area perpendicularly is known as a magnetic flux. Its unit is Weber (wb). It is a scalar quantity. However, the flux per unit area describes a magnetic field .      Consider a small area is placed at any point P in space through which field lines are passing normally as shown in , then the magnetic field B is given by  where is the angle between and . Hence the total magnetic flux through that area is given by                 There are three ways to change magnetic flux  change the size of area [ ];  change the magnitude of magnetic field [ ]; and  change the orientation of plane [ ].      Gauss's Law for Magnetism  The net magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero, ie., This statement is based on the experimental fact that isolated magnetic poles (monopoles) never exist and that all magnetic fields are actually generated by circulating currents. The number of magnetic field-lines entering any closed surface is always equal to the number of field-lines leaving that surface. Thus, magnetic field-lines behave in a quite different manner to electric field-lines, which begin on positive charges, end on negative charges, and never form closed loops.    Velocity Selector      A velocity selector velocity selector is a region where a uniform electric field, is perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, and both are perpendicular to the initial velocity, of the charged particles. The force exerted on a charged particle by the electric field is and the force exerted by the magnetic field is as long as the velocity is perpendicular to the field. If the two forces are equal and opposite, the net force and the particle passes through the region without changing direction. However, magnetic force is velocity dependent hence when charges traveling faster or slower than the ones that go straight through will be deflected oneway or another out of the beam as shown in . The cross in a circle representing the magnetic field is going into the paper . If a positive charge moves into a magnetic field with direction perpendicular to the field, it will follow a circular path where magnetic force provides a necessary centripetal force, i.e., Magnetic force acting on a charge particle is always perpendicular to the velocity of the charge in a uniform magnetic field hence, it takes a circular path. For a particle moving in a gravitational field, acquires vertical and horizontal components of velocity and hence starts moving in a parabolic path. If the projectlie has sufficient horizontal velocity then it also starts rotating around the planet in a circular path. Gravitational force and field are acting along the same direction but this is not the case for magnetic force and field. ; but .     This principle is applied in mass spectrometer to seperate of heavy ions (or, isotopes) from lighter ones. If  then charge moves without deflection along x axis. If then increases and the charge deflects along +y axis and follow the upward circular track. If then decreases and the charge deflects along -y axis and follow the downward citcular track.    Cyclotron Frequency  The cyclotron cyclotron is a device for accelerating ions in a constant magnetic field by the repeated application of accelerating potentials. A cyclotron consists of two hollow semicircular electrodes, called dees , mounted back to back, separated by a narrow gap, in an evacuated chamber between the poles of a magnet. An electric field, alternating in polarity, is created in the gap by a radio-frequency oscillator.      The positive ions produced from a source at the center are accelerated by a dee which is at the negative potential at that moment. Due to the presence of magnetic field (pointed into the page) the ions will move in a circular path inside the dees. The magnetic field and the frequency of applied voltage are so adjusted that as the ion comes out of a dee, the dees change their polarity (+ve dee becomes -ve and vice-versa) and the ion is further accelerated and moves with higher velocity along a circular path of greater radius as shown in . Once the ion reaches to the periphery of the dees it gets deflected out from the dees to bombard a target.  Suppose the positive ion having charge moves in a dee with a velocity , then magnetic force = centripetal force, i.e.,  where is the mass of ion, is the radius of the path of ion in a dee, and is the magnetic field strength. The angular velcity of the ion is given by, The time taken by the ion in describing a semi circle, ie., to turning by an angle is,  Hence the time taken by an ion in a dee is constant and is independent upon its velocity and radius. From eqn. it is clear if is known for any ion then can be calculated for producing resonance with the high frequency alternating potential source, i.e., the frequency of alternating source can be     Mass Spectrometer      It is an instrument used to measure the masses of ions. The principle behind mass spectrometry mass spectrometer is that a charged particle passing through a magnetic field is deflected along a circular path on a radius that is proportional to the mass to charge ratio, Ions are accelerated through the region between electric potentials and enter into the uniform magnetic field where it follows the circular path and falls at different location depends upon it mass as shown in .    Hall Effect      When an electrical current passes through a conductor placed in a magnetic field, a potential proportional to the current and to the magnetic field is developed across the material in a direction perpendicular to both the current and to the magnetic field. This effect is known as the Hall effect Hall effect . The magnetic field exerts a transverse force on the moving charge carriers which tends to push them to one side of the conductor and develops a potential difference across the conductor known as Hall voltage as shown in . Hall effect is very useful in determining types of charge carriers in a semiconductor.   "

  "body": " Magnetic Field of a Moving Charge:         Permeability of Free Space,  The property of space which permit magnetic flux to pass through it is known as permeability. It is a measure of relative increase or decrease in the resultant magnetic field inside a material compared with the magnetizing field H in which the given material is located. It is a constant of proportionality that exists between magnetic induction (magnetic flux density) B and magnetic field intensity (magnetizing field) H. For free space   Materials may be classified magnetically on the basis of their permeabilities. Materials that cause the lines of flux to move farther apart, resulting in a decrease in magnetic flux density compared with a vacuum, are called diamagnetic . Materials that concentrate magnetic flux by a factor of more than 1 but less than or equal to 10 are called paramagnetic ; materials that concentrate the flux by a factor of more than 10 are called ferromagnetic . The permeability factors of some substances change with rising or falling temperature, or with the intensity of the applied magnetic field. Permeability is often expressed in relative, rather than in absolute, terms. If be the permeability of free space, be the permeability of the given substance, then the relative permeability, , is given by:     Magnetic Field of a Current Element (Biot Savart Law)        Magnetic Field of a straight wire                   Consider a current carrying straight conductor of length 2a. To find a magnetic field at a point P from the conductor consider a small current element on a conductor and use Biot-Savart's law, The direction of magnetic field at P is given by right hand grip rule which is going into the plane of the paper. is unit vector along and is angle between current element and line joining the current element to point P.    Now solve the integrand first with the help of geometry of the figure then substitute the value to obtain B.              When (ie., for infinitely long wire) then , hence     When then , hence       Magnetic field due to a current loop   on axis of Coil with N turns. at center of Coil with N turns. Magnetic field at a point P due to a current element is given by From Biot-Savart's law and is directed normal to the plane subtends by and . angle between and is        Due to symmetry of current along the ring y components of field cancel out but x component survived, hence     If number of turns in a circular loop is N, then along the x-axis.  Magnetic field at the center (ie., x=0) of a current carrying loop is     Magnetic field at the center of a Helmholtz coil  Helmholtz coils consist of two similar co-axial coils A and B having same radius, same number of turns, and placed parallel to each other at a distance equal to their radii as shown in . When the coils are connected in such a way that the current flows through the coils in the same direction, then Helmholtz coils produce nearly uniform magnetic field over a considerable region between the coils.      Magnetic field at the axial point at a distance x from the center of the coil of radius a, number of turns N, and carrying current I is given by along x-axis.  The rate of variation of magnetic field B along x-axis is given by   For uniform variation of , must be constant and must be zero. Hence,    Thus, the rate of variation of magnetic field is constant at distance from the center of the coil. Therefore on either side of point P, the field due to one coil decreases uniformly, while that due to another is increases uniformly. Since both the coils are identical and carry the same amount of current in same direction the decrease in field due to one coil is balanced by the increase in field by another one. Hence overall magnetic field remains uniform over a considerable region on either side of the point P. The resultant magnetic field B between the region of coils are obtained by substituting the value of in eqn. . We have       Magnetic field at a point due to current carrying solenoid  Solenoid is a long wire wound in a closed-packed helix which behaves as a magnet when carrying an electric current. Magnetic field is directed along the axis of solenoid and can be determined by right hand grip rule [ ].  Consider a solenoid of radius a, number of turns per unit length n and a length of current element so that total number of turns in strip ABCD is . If current I is flowing through a solenoid then the field at point P due to current element is given by       from eqn.  From           For an infinitely long solenoid, Hence, If point P is at the end of a solenoid, Hence, Thus for a long solenoid the magnetic field at the ends is half of that at the middle of the solenoid.

The induced emf resulting from a changing magnetic flux has a polarity that leads to an induced current whose direction is such that the induced magnetic field opposes the original flux change.  When the magnetic flux is increasing, a magnetic field opposing to the increasing field is generated by induced current.  When the magnetic flux is decreasing, a magnetic field in the same direction as the decreasing field is generated by the induced current.    "

  "body": " Induced Electric Fields       Eddy Currents  When a conductor is moved in a magnetic field, there is a force on the electrons, which then move in the metal. This movement is called an eddy current. The induced currents produce magnetic fields which tend to oppose the motion of the metal. An eddy current is a swirling current set up in a conductor in response to a changing magnetic field. According to Lenz's law the current swirls in the conductor in such a way that it opposes the changing magnetic field. To do so in a conductor, electrons swirl in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. As the metal enters into the magnetic field, flux starts increasing so to oppose this flux electrons of metal make loop in such a way that the induced current has magnetic field opposing the increase. As the metal plate begins leaving the magnetic field current loops on metal surface just in opposite direction to the previous loops as shown in .      Because of the tendency to oppose, eddy currents cause energy to be lost. Due to eddy currents kinetic energy transforms into heat energy. One of the practical applications of eddy currents is magnetic braking . During braking, the metal wheels are exposed to a magnetic field from an electromagnet, generating eddy currents in the wheels. The magnetic interaction between the applied field and the eddy currents acts to slow the wheels down. The faster the wheels are spinning, the stronger the effect, meaning that as the train slows the braking force is reduced, producing a smooth stopping motion.  French physicist Leon Foucault in 1855 discovered eddy currents. He found that the force needed to rotate a copper disk when its rim is placed between the poles of a magnet, such as a horseshoe magnet, increases and the disk is heated by the induced eddy currents.  The heating effect originates from the transformation of electric energy into heat energy and is used in induction heating devices, like some cookers and welders. The resistance felt by the eddy currents in a conductor causes Joule heating and he amount of heat generated is proportional to the current squared. However, for applications like motors, generators and transformers, this heat is considered wasted energy and as such, eddy currents need to be minimized. This can be achieved by laminating the metal cores of these devices, where each core is made up of multiple insulated sheets of metal. This splits the core in many individual magnetic circuits and restricts the flow of the eddy currents through it, reducing the amount of heat generated through Joule heating.  Eddy currents can also be removed by cracks or slits in the conductor, which break the circuit and prevent the current loops from circulating. This means that eddy currents can be used to detect defects in materials. This is called nondestructive testing and is often used in airplanes. The magnetic field produced by the eddy currents is measured, where a change in the field reveals the presence of an irregularity; a defect will reduce the size of the eddy current, which in turn reduces the magnetic field strength.    Generator  A generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. As Faraday's law holds good for any shape of conductor moving in a magnetic field, this principle can be used to design electric dynamo or generator where a loop is rataing in a magnetic field.               Consider a closed rectangular loop C of number of turns N, area of each loop is A rotating in a uniform magnetic field B with angular velocity . As the loop rotates, the flux linked with the coil changes and an emf is induced in the coil. Suppose at any instant the normal to plane of loop is making an angle with the magnetic field B, then magnetic flux linked with loop at that time is given by    where = maximum emf.  If this loop is part of a circuit, this emf will induce an Alternating Current (AC) in the circuit. If R is the resistance of the circuit, the induced current in the circuit is given by where is the amplitude of the ac current.    Skin Effect  When a steady current flows through a wire, it is distributed uniformly over the entire cross-section of the wire. On the other hand, when an alternating current flows through the a wire, it is concentrated mostly near the outer surface of wire rather than the uniform distribution. This effect is called skin effect of alternating current. The skin effect increases with increasing frequency. In case of very high frequency current is almost wholly confined to the surface layer of the wire. This is the reason in ac transmission current carrier wire is made out of collection of many thin insulated stranded wires rather than one thick single wire. Electromagnetic induction is the cause of skin effect.

  "body": " Self-Inductance:   The phenomenon of the production of induced emf in a circuit itself due to the change in current through it is called self induction and induced emf is called back emf. The delayed response of changing current in a circuit like solenoid is due to a self induction. This is because the changing magnetic flux through the solenoid produces a self-induced emf to initially oppose any changes as prescribed by Lenz's Law. This effect is known as coefficient of self-induction or self-inductance of the coil. Actually all circuit elements have some self-inductance. However, only coils with many turns of wire, such as in a solenoid, have substantial self-inductance.  Let current I is flowing through a circuit C [ ]. This current will set up a magnetic field and hence a magnetic flux is linked with the circuit. As the magnetic field at any point is proportional to the current flowing through the circuit, the magnetic flux linked to the circuit at any instant is also proportional to the current I flowing through it at the same instant. For any geometry of loop, the magnetic flux through the loop, produced by the current in the loop is  The inductance L is the constant of proportionality. Its unit is henery. When the current flowing through a circuit is changed, the magnetic flux linked with the circuit also changes and induced emf is set up in the circuit.      The rate of change of flux linked with the circuit is given by Therefore from Faraday's law the emf induced in the circuit is Which is also a Self-Induced Emf in an inductor and L is its inductance.

The circuit in which current changes is known as primary circuit, while the neighboring circuit in which emf is induced in called the secondary circuit.  Consider a circuit is placed in a magnetic field of another circuit as shown in . The flux linked with circuit depends upon its relative position with circuit and current flowing through If is the current flowing in circuit and is the magnetic field at any point (x,y,z) in space around , then the magnetic flux linked with the coil is given by Where represents the effective surface area enclosed by the coil If the shapes, orientations and the positions of the two circuits and are fixed, then the magnetic flux linked with the circuit is proportional to the current flowing in circuit i.e.,        Where is constant of proportionality and is termed as mutual inductance of circuit with respect to circuit Now, emf induced in a circuit is Similarly, emf induced in a circuit due current flowing in circuit is If shapes, orientations, and the positions of the coils are fixed, then the mutual inductance of the two coils does not depend upon which circuits carries the current i.e., . The mutual inductance of two neighboring coils and mutually induced emfs are given by the following equations.

As a result a self induced emf is set up in the coil which opposes the rise of current in the circuit. Hence the current does not attain its final steady value instantaneously.                  Integrating, we get -          From this equation it is clear that the current in the circuit rises according to an exponential law. The quantity L\/R is known as the time constant of L-R circuit.

Decay of current When the switch is disconnected from point 1 and connected to point 2 then the current begins to decays through the resistance R from maximum its value to zero.

  "body": " The Complex Number Method for A.C. Analysis   The complex algebra can be used to simplifies many ac problems. Let us review briefly some of the properties of complex numbers. In the expression z is a complex quantity which has x and y as real components and is an imaginary quantity. Complex numbers can be represented graphically by imaging their real components as abscissas and their imaginary components as ordinates as shown in . In such plot the complex quantity is represented by a vector, whose length indicates the magnitude of the complex quantity, and whose direction indicates the relative proportion of its real and imaginary constituents. The multiplication of complex vector by j is a vector operation producing a counterclock wise rotation of the complex vector without changing its magnitude. Thus, has the direction in second quadrant and the vectors resulting from two further multiplications by j being in third and fourth quadrant as shown in .      The sinusoidal voltage or current can be easily represented by rotating vectors scheme. The rotating vectors are called phasors and diagram containing them are called phasor diagrams . Since the vectors are rotating in this scheme it is better to express the complex quantity in polar co-ordinate system. Suppose r is any vector making an angle with the real axis then we have  Hence   see Euler's equation in appendix where, or is called a modulus and is called the argument or phase of the complex quantity z. The sinusoidal current and voltage are now considered as the imaginary parts of and respectively. In an expression of alternating current  is the initial phase of the current.    Impedance, Reactance, and Admittance  Direct current in a circuit can be controlled by a resistance only, but to control alternating current resistance, inductance, and capacitance can also be used. In alternating current the ratio of potential difference across the circuit to the current flowing through it is known as impedance, Z where Physically impedance in ac (alternating current) circuit is the resistance offered by it in the flow of alternating current just as the resistance in the flow of direct current in the dc circuit. The resistance offered by the inductance and capacitance to the flow of alternating current in the ac circuit is known as the Reactance, X . The reactance due to inductance is called inductive reactance, and that due to capacitance is called capacitive reactance, . The inverse of the impedance is called the admittance, Y , i.e., Hence     Resistance in an AC Circuit  Consider an alternating sinusoidal voltage an imaginary part of is applied across a resistor of resistance R, [ ] then the current flowing through it at any instant of time is given by              Phasor diagram        Hence the actual current is which is an imaginary part of Since the current and voltage rise and fall simultaneously, they are in phase with each other as shown in . The projection of peak voltage and current vectors rotating continuously in anti-clockwise direction with an angular velocity [ ] and lying completely along the x-axis at t = 0, T, 2T, etc.   Alternative:    This implies that is in phase with [ ].    Inductance in an AC Circuit  Consider an alternating emf is applied across an inductor of inductance L, and I be the current flowing through it then from the circuit [ ] we have              Phasor diagram              is the amplitude of actual current, This expression indicates that the current through the inductor is also alternating but lagging behind the emf by or with phase difference. In the quantity has the dimension of reactance The reciprocal of inductive reactance is called inductive susceptance which is The inductive reactance measures the hindrance to the flow of ac just like resistance R in purely resistive circuit. Unlike resistances the average power consumed by inductance is zero. In an expression the quantity is the total resistance in an ac circuit hence it is called the impedance Z of the inductance. That is     Alternative:    This implies that is lagging behind by phase     Capacitance in an AC Circuit  Consider an alternating emf is applied across a capacitor of capacitance C, and I be the current flowing through it then from the circuit [ ] we have                 Phasor diagram      We can write  where, is the peak value of altenating current, Hence, in this case also current is alternating sinusoidal with frequency but leading the emf by phase as shown in .  In this case, the capacitive reactance and impedance, The capacitive reactance measures the hindrance to the flow of ac just like resistance R in purely resistive circuit. The reciprocal of capacitive reactance is called capacitive susceptance which is . Even though capacitor provide hindrance to the flow of current it does not consume any energy over a cycle.   Alternative:    This implies that is leading by phase [ ].    Variation of reactance due to R, L and C with angular frequency in an AC circuit          Power in an AC Circuit  Power is dc circuit is given by as voltage and current in dc circuit is constant but in ac circuit they are changing with time hence in ac circuit instantaneous power dissipated can be determined as where is a phase difference between current and voltage.        Therefore average power dissipated over a cycle is given by    Hence if current and voltage is out of phase then and average power consumption in ac circuit is zero. Here is called a Power Factor which can be defined as     AC Circuit with Resistance and Inductance in Series  Let emf of be applied to a circuit containing a resistor R and an inductor L in series as shown in , then from Kirchhoff's law, we have           which is a complex quantity. see .

It uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to transform electrical energy from one circuit to another. The AC power is more preferential over dc power as it can be transmitted at high voltage and low currents with significantly small power loss and can be subsequently transformed to modest voltage and larger currents near destination with the help of transformer. It can transform power into large variety of voltage and currents by using step-up, or step-down transformer with desired numbers of turns at primary and secondary coils. It can also be used as impedance matching device in order to get maximum power transfer [read ] from generator to load. It can also be used as ac coupling between two circuits that are not from the same dc potential.   Transformer    Schematic     Step Up     Step Down     in circuit      A typical transformer [ ] consists of a two or more coils of insulated wire wound on a laminated iron core. An alternating voltage which is to be reduced or increased is connected to the coil, called the primary coil or input coil. This coil magnetizes the iron core. A voltage is then induced in the other coil, called the secondary coil or output coil. The change of voltage (or voltage ratio) between the primary and secondary depends on the turns ratio of the two coils. There are two types of transformer on the basis of their operation. If the number of turns in primary coil is less than that at secondary then it is called a step-up transformer [ ] and if number of turns in primary is grater than that in secondary then it is called a step down transformer [ ].  Let us consider a transformer as shown in circuit . Consider and are inductances, resistances, and number of turns in primary and secondary coils, respectively. Mutual inductance of the two coils is and impedances of the generator and load are and , respectively, then from Kirchhoff's law -   The choice of signs preceding final terms depends on the current flowing through the two coils. Hence by solving  we get - and Hence voltage drop at primary coil, and In an ideal transformer flux due to one coil is completely passes through the other, i.e., hence the coupling constant k becomes unity, Since and in an ideal transformer is zero, and reactance of the two coils are so large in comparison to the generator and load impedances, we can write and Hence for an ideal transformer but   Also    This equation shows the voltage transformation property of a transformer. Also we have i.e., Input power = output power.  Hence the ideal transformer introduces no power loss with efficiency. Which is not the case in real transformer where loss happen in the form of eddy current loss, hysteresis loss, copper loss, and flux leakage loss .  "

If the wall of a room is 17 meter away from the source of sound then it reflects back from the wall and reaches to the ear within 0.1 s. hence causing a prolonged sound effect, called a reverberation.  Echoes are also the effect of reflection of sound waves perceived by the ear. When a reflected sound wave reaches the ear after 0.1 seconds of the original sound was heard then echoes are produced. If the elapsed time between the arrivals of the two sound waves is more than 0.1 seconds, then the sensation of the first sound will have died out. In other words, echo is a sensation of second sound wave after the effect of original sound wave will vanish. It is not a prolonging of the original sound wave as in reverberation.

  "title": "Beats",
  "body": " Beats  The phenomenon of producing a maximum loudness periodically when two sound waves of same amplitude and slightly different frequencies are superimposed is known as beats . The frequency of the beats depends upon the difference in frequency of the two waves. If the frequency difference is larger than 20 Hz, a tone is usually perceived separately rather than distinct beats. Beat frequency is given by where and are frequencies of the two waves. When two such waves superimpose there is a variation in amplitude of resulting wave which causes the change in loudness and hence the beats are produced.      Two waves of different frequency     Superposition of two waves      Consider two waves are interfering to each other, then the resultant wave is given by    where is the average of and and is one half of their difference. The amplitude factor varies slowly with . The frequency of this second term is , but the ear cannot hear the inversion of phase that occurs when phase is negative and the difference is small. This term is responsible for the beating effect, and is known as an envelope. The sine factor varies with a frequency There are two times that the envelope (cosine term) passes through zero for every wavelength, so the beat frequency is twice the frequency of the envelope and is given by the magnitude of the difference of the two frequencies, i.e., beat frequency   "

  "title": "Doppler Effect",
  "body": " Doppler Effect   The Doppler effect is the change in perceived frequency of a source due to the relative motion between the source and the receiver. It applies to all sorts of waves. Doppler effect can be experienced as the change in frequency or pitch received when an ambulance passes by. When the ambulence is approaching, the pitch of siren is getting higher than the actual frequency of siren. When the ambulence passes by, the frequency sounds the same as the actual emitted frequency and when the ambulance is moving away, the pitch is getting lower than the actual emitted frequency. When the source of the waves is coming towards the observer, observer receives more waves every second compared to being at rest. That is waves bunch together for the observer giving impression for the decrease of wavelength and causing an increase in the frequency. Conversely, if the source of waves is going away from the observer, observer receives less waves every second compared to being at rest. That is waves spread out for the observer giving impression for the increase of wavelength and causing a decrease in the frequency as shown in . Since the velocity of sound is comparable to the listener's velocity and it propagates only in medium, Doppler effect may be the consequence of motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium. Each of these effects is analyzed separately. For waves which do not require a medium such as light, only the relative velocity between the observer and the source needs to be considered.      Stationary Source and Listners     Source towards Listner      As source of sound moves there is a change in wavelength perceived by the listener and if listener moves there is a change relative velocity of the sound can be measured by the listener. Hence the frequency (or pitch, ) of sound perceived by the listner can be determined by where and are the relative velocity of sound and effective wavelength of sound wave for the listner.    Stationary source and listener  If source and listener both are at rest then there is no change in pitch i.e., here , v and are the frequency, velocity, and wavelength of sound wave, respectively.    Source is moving towards stationary listener  If source is moving towards listener with a velocity then listener receives more waves everysecond causes decrease in wavelength. Hence pitch of sound heard by the listener is given by  When source is moving towards the listener wavelength squeezed by for every cycle of wave. Here T is a time period of the wave.    Source is moving away from stationary listner  If source is moving away from the listener wavelength stretched out by for every cycle of wave. Hence pitch is given by     Listener is moving towards a stationary source  If listener is moving towards a stationary source of sound with a velocity then the relative velocity of sound is changed for the listener. Hence pitch of sound heard by the listener is given by  The direction of sound velocity is taken as positive and hence if listener is moving towards the source then the relative velocity increased.    Listener is moving away from a stationary source  If listener is moving away from a stationary source of sound with a velocity then the relative velocity of sound for the listener is . Hence pitch of sound heard by the listener is given by     Source and listener move towards each other  In ths case pitch is given by      Source and listener move away from each other  In ths case pitch is given by      Sign Rules for Doppler Effect:        Remember: If a source is going away from a listener then denominator has to increase (i.e. ) to lower the pitch. If a source is coming towards a listener then denominator has to decrease (i.e. ) to raise the pitch.   "

  "title": "Sonic Boom",
  "body": " Sonic Boom  A loud noise that is created by the shock wave is called a sonic boom. When source of sound is traveling faster than the speed of sound then it produces a sonic boom. Any thing moving faster than the speed of sound is called a supersonic speed. An aircraft which is going at subsonic speeds (lower than that of sound), its sound wave is radiated in all directions in such a way that the individual wavefronts are bunched at he front of the aircraft and spread at the back of it because of forward motion of the aircraft as shown in . This effect is well known as Doppler effect which changes the pitch of the aircraft's sound as it passes us. When the plane is approaching us its sound has a higher pitch than if it is going away from us. If the aircraft is traveling with the same speed as that of sound (called sonic speed) then the aircraft is at the leading edge of wavefronts that it produces as shown in . All the wavefronts are bunched up at the front of the aircraft. This phenomenon is known as a shock wave. If the aircraft is traveling at the supersonic speeds, then a pressure wave is produced in the shape of the cone whose vertex is at the nose of the aircraft, and whose base is behind the plane. The angle opening of the cone depends on the actual speed the plane is traveling at. All of the sound pressure is contained in this cone as shown in . Now imagine that this aircraft is in a level flight. Before the aircraft passes you, you can only see it but you can not hear anything. The pressure cone is trailing behind the aircraft. Once your ears intersect the edge of this cone, your will hear a very loud sound - the sonic boom. Therefore you will hear the sonic boom once your ears intersect this cone.      source at rest     subsonic     sonic     supersonic      The ratio of the speed of a sound source, (speed of aircraft) to the speed of sound, v in a fluid is known as the Mach number. Speed less than the speed of sound have a Mach number between zero and one and are described as subsonic. Those greater than the speed of sound have Mach numbers greater than one are a described as supersonic. Speeds approximately equal to the speed of sound have Mach numbers approximately equal to one and are described as transonic. The angle at the vertex of shock waves is called Mach angle . where t is the time taken by the sound to reach the ground when aircraft travels the horizontal distance of .  When an object travels slower than the spped of sound, the Mach angle is greater than one, and the equation does not have a real solution. This is because there is no shock wave at subsonic speeds. Traveling at the speed of sound makes the ratio equal one and results in a Mach angle of ninety degrees. At transonic speeds the shock wave is a wall of high pressure moving with the object, perpendicular to its velocity. Above the speed of sound, the ratio is less than one and the Mach angle is less than ninety degrees. The faster the object moves, the narrower the cone of high pressure behind it becomes. Measuring the vertex angle is thus a simple way to determine the speed of a supersonic object.  "

What is the frequency heard by an observer  at rest in front of the car,  at rest behind the car,  moving to the left at 20 m\/s in front of the car,  moving to the right at 20 m\/s behind the car?    Two cars have identical horns which emit frequencies. The first car is at rest and the second is moving away from the first at 30 m\/s. An observer is between the two cars moving away from the first at a speed of 10 m\/s. There is a 5 m\/s wind blowing toward the first car from the direction of the other two cars. The speed of sound is 340 m\/s.  What is the frequency of the first car as heard by the observer?  What is the frequency of the second car as heard by the observer?  What is the beat frequency heard by the observer?    A galaxy is observed to have a red shift in its spectrum which doubles the wavelength of each spectral line.  Is the galaxy moving toward us or away from us?  How fast is the galaxy moving?  What is the distance to the galaxy in light years assuming the universe is 12 billion years old?    Two horns using the same design are supposed to be playing (simultaneously) a sustained resonant note of 300.0 Hz, but they are not quite identical so the longer instrument is a bit off. If the beat sound annoys listeners with a 5-second cycle, what is the frequency from the off-tune instrument?   "

Corpuscles are tiny, light, and elastic in nature which travel in a straight line with very high velocities and can pass through interstices of the particles of matter and posses the property of reflection and transmission. The first unsuccessful attempt to find the velocity of light was made by Galileo in 1600. In 1679, Christian Huygens proposed the wave nature of light. In 1873 James Clerk Maxwell predicted the electromagnetic waves and calculated speed of light in vacuum by using formula where is electric permitivitty and is magnetic permeability of vacuum.  "

  "title": "Huygens’s Principle",
  "body": " Huygens's Principle  According to Huygens, a source of light sends out waves in all directions, through a hypothetical medium called ether .      Consider a source, S as shown in (a) which is sending out light in the form of waves in all directions. If v be the velocity of propagation of the wave then at time, t, all the particles of the medium on the surface, xy will be vibrating in phase. Hence, xy is a portion of the sphere of radius, vt with center, S. The surface, xy is called a wavefront. A wavefront is a locus of all the points of the medium which are vibrating in phase in every interval of time. If the distance is small then wavefront takes shape of a source such as point source emits spherical wavefronts and line source emits cylindrical wavefronts but if the source is at a large distance, then any small portion of the wavefront can be considered as plane wavefront as shown in (b). The radius of wavefront is considered as ray of light. Thus rays of light diverging from or converging to a point give rise to a spherical wavefront and a parallel beam of light gives rise to a plane wavefront. According to Huygens, every point on the primary wavefront (1, 2, 3, etc.,) behaves as the secondary source of light. These secondary waves are called wavelets that travel in space with the same velocity as the original wave and the envelope of the all the secondary wavelets after given interval of time gives rise to a secondary wavefront. As the secondary wavelets are spherical this would lead to backward propagation of the wave. In time, t' the secondary waves travel a distance, vt' with points (1, 2, 3, etc.) being their centers. Hence the envelope is a secondary wavefront and is a backward wavefront. Now according to Huygens principle only forward wavefronts are plausible not the backward wavefront. The rear envelope of these wavelets is shown by which cannot represent the next wavefront after the time, t. This can be explained using Stoke's law. According to this law, the amplitude at each point of the secondary wave is proportional to where is the angle between the wave normal ( or, ) and the direction of propagation which is the line, joining the point of the secondary wave to its centre. For the backward wavefront, . Hence no effect of secondary wavelets is observed in the backward direction because amplitude is zero.  The nature of light described by Newton's corpuscular theory and Huygens wave theory both have some drawbacks. Corpuscular theory explained somehow the phenomenon of reflection and transmission but unable to explain many observed phenomena such as interference, diffraction, and double refraction. Similarly Huygens idea explained about reflection, double refraction, transmission, interference, and diffraction but unable to explain some other phenomena such as polarization and photoelectric effect. After Fresnel suggestion that the light wave is rather transverse in nature than a longitudinal, polarization can be explained satisfactorily. It also predicted that the velocity of light is slower in optically denser medium which was not the case in Newton's corpuscular theory. When Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect the presence of ether medium in 1887 the concept of ether was abandoned.  The photoelectric effect introduced evidence that light exhibited particle properties on the quantum scale. The particle properties of electrons was well documented when DeBroglie hypothesis and Davidson and Germer experiment established the wave nature of electron. Hence quantum view of light rely on dual nature of light. However, for ordinary optics the wave view of light is the practical approach.  "

  "title": "Reflection",
  "body": " Reflection   When wave travels in a homogeneous medium strikes on the surface of another medium bouncing back to the same medium is known as reflection. There are two types of reflection, spectacular (regular) reflection and diffuse (irregular) reflection. Both types of reflection obey the Laws of reflection.    Laws of Reflection  The first law of reflection states that the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the point of incident all lie in the same plane. The second law of reflection states that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.               Consider a plane wave progressing towards a smooth surface, like glass or mirror as shown in . A light ray, AO perpendicular to the wavefronts is making an angle of incidence, i with the normal, N. The side, X of the progressing wavefront, XY has just made contact with the surface of the mirror. While Y is moving the distance, vt, a secondary wavelet emanates from X and also travels the distance, vt. At the end of the time interval, t, Y will have just made contact with the surface, at the point Y'. The new reflected wavefront is found from Huygens's principle by drawing the new wave front such that it touches the point Y' and is tangent to the secondary wavelet from X. The point of tangency is called X'. The new wavefront is shown in as the blue line X'Y'. The wave is said to have been reflected. The new reflected ray, OB is drawn perpendicular to the wavefront, X'Y'. The rest of the reflected wavefronts are drawn parallel to X'Y' and perpendicular to ray, OB. The reflected ray, OB makes an angle r is called the angle of reflection , with the normal, N. Because the incident ray, AO is perpendicular to the wavefront, XY, the angle that the wavefront, XY makes with the surface is the same as the angle of incidence, i. This can be seen by looking at triangle, . The sum of all the angles in triangle, XEO must equal , and consider then      Similarly, since reflected ray OB is perpendicular to reflected wavefront X'Y', it makes an angle r with the reflecting surface. We see in the figure that in triangle XYY', From , we have  Which proves the second law of reflection and it says that the angle of incidence i is equal to the angle of reflection r. The first law of reflection was implied in the derivation and it says that the incident ray, the normal, and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane. We have derived the law of reflection by Huygens's principle and the wave nature of light. Having thus established the law, we can simplify the procedure for its use by drawing the ray diagram as in where the faint blue plane is an imaginary plane which contains the incident ray, (OA), the normal, (ON), and the reflected ray, (OB).    Regular and Diffuse Reflection  Reflection from a smooth surface such as a mirror leads to a type of reflection known as regular reflection. In regular reflection a parallel incident beam after reflection deviates parallely onto another direction as shown . Reflection from a rough surface such as paper, wall, and clothes leads to a diffuse reflection. In diffuse reflection rays of light in a parallel incident beam after reflection scattered in different directions as shown in . Whether it is a regular or a diffuse reflection laws of reflection are always obeyed by each individual light ray of the beam at every point of incidence. The normals at the point of incidences P, Q, and R in are shown by the dotted lines. The normal on a rough surface depends on a inclination of local surface at the point of incidence hence these normals are not parallel which constitutes parallel beam of light to be scattered in different directions. The orientation of the normal lines at neighboring points along a surface differentiates specular from diffuse reflection. If the normal lines are parallel, reflection will be specular. If they are not parallel, reflection will be diffuse.               It is the diffuse reflection which makes us see the world such as walls of the room, clothes, trees, stars, clouds, etc. As the rays of light falls on any object, the rays are reflected from the object and then enter into our eye. If the reflection is only regular then the object would be dazzlingly bright. Aside from the limited number of luminous objects, such as light bulbs and the sun, everything we see around us is visible because of the diffuse reflection.    Image formed by a mirror   A plane reflecting surface is a special surface of spherical reflecting surface with infinite radius of curvature. A mirror is a highly polished smooth surface which allows a regular reflection. When these reflected rays fall in our eyes we see the image of that object. Depends upon the shape of reflecting surface there are many types of mirror such as plane mirror, spherical mirror, parabolic mirror, etc. There are also two types of existence of image (or object) called a real image or object and a virtual image or object . If incident rays are coming from an object lying in front of the mirror, object is known as real. If incident rays appear to converge behind the mirror, the point of convergence is known as virtual object. If reflected rays actually converge the image formed is real. A real image is always formed in front of the mirror. If reflected rays are divergent that is they do not meet actually, rather they appear to come from a point, that point is called virtual image. A virtual image is always formed behind the mirror. In real image light rays which constitute an image is really passing through it. In virtual image the light rays which constitute that image do not actually pass through it but only appear to do so. Real image can be cast on a screen but virtual image can not be cast on a screen as it is formed behind the reflecting surface. Plane mirror never form a real image of any real object.    Plane Mirror  A plane mirror is a highly smoothed flat surface or a glass plate. One side of the plate is silver coated and is called a silvered surface , another side of it is highly smoothed (fine polished) from which light beam undergoes a regular reflection to form an image and is called a reflecting surface as shown in . In other words, if a reflecting surface is plane or if radius of curvature of the surface is infinite then it behaves like a mirror, and is called a plane mirror . Any thing from which light rays emanate and incident to the mirror is called an object . The reflected rays from the mirror either actually converge to a point or appear to diverge from a point. The point of intersection of reflected rays is called an image .                   When an object, O is placed in front of a plane mirror, MN an image I is formed behind the mirror. To determine how an image is formed, we need to consider at least two light rays that emanate from the object, O. Consider the ray, OA which makes an angle of incidence, i with the normal to the mirror. By the law of reflection, this ray is reflected along AB such that the angle of reflection is r. When these reflected light rays enters into the observer's eye it appears to have come from behind the mirror from point, I as indicated by the dashed line. The second incident ray, OC is reflected along CD. To an observer in front of the mirror at D this reflected ray also appears to come from the same point I behind the mirror, as indicated by the dashed line. The two reflected rays appear to have come from the point I behind the mirror where the two dashed lines intersect. The point I is called the image of the object O. The distance from the image to the mirror is called the image distance and is designated by the letter q. The image is called a virtual image because the light rays do not actually come from that point, they only appear to come from that point. If you were to walk behind the mirror, you would not find any real image there. A real image can be projected onto a screen while a virtual image cannot. In general, a real image is one on which all the rays are converging, while a virtual image is one from which all the rays are diverging. Thus, rays AB and CD are diverging away from the virtual image I and will never cross on the left-hand side of the mirror. We should also note that there is a third ray that can be used. This is the ray that is perpendicular to the mirror. Since its angle of incidence is zero, its reflected angle is also zero, and the ray is reflected back along the normal. This ray appears to come from directly behind the mirror and is also indicated by a dashed line that comes from the image point I.  An image formed by a plane mirror is virtual, object distance is equal to image distance, and the size of image is the same as the size of object.  From the geometry of the   Hence in and , we have [ OP and IP is perpendicular on mirror MN.]   In congruent triangles corresponding arms are equal hence, object distance, OP is equal to image distance, IP. Since no light rays are really passing through the point I constituting a virtual image. To understand the size of the image formed by a plane mirror let us consider an extended object P as shown in . Because object distance is equal to image distance the rays from each point of an object reflected from the mirror in such a way that they appear to come from the side wise inverted image behind the mirror. Hence a letter p looks like q in image. The process of inversion of left side of an object as its right side of its mirror image is known as a lateral inversion . From the it is clearly seen that the each rays from the object p incident normally onto the mirror and get reflected also normally so that each rays are parallel to each other. Which verifies the size of the image is equal to the size of the object. When the plane mirror is rotated through an angle , the reflected ray turns through keeping the incident ray constant, as shown in .  In , is called glancing angle. It is the angle made by the incident ray with the reflecting surface so that . Now , vertically opposite angle and Since and i.e, . Once the mirror, LM is rotated by an angle and takes the position L'M' then the new glancing is and .        Inclined Mirrors  The number of images formed by inclined mirrors depend upon the angle of inclination of the mirrors, object position, and observer's position. The proof of the number of images formed in such case is not the part of this book but from the experimental verification the following formula will be helpful to find the maximum number of images formed by inclined plane mirrors. where is the angle of inclination of plane mirrors and n is number of images formed.      If there can be even number of segments of then the number of images formed is given by n-1 or if the number of segments of is odd then number of images formed will be n only. That is if then number of images, and if , then number of images, .   "

  "title": "Spherical Mirror",
  "body": " Spherical Mirror   Spherical mirror is a part of spherical surface which is polished in such a way that one of its side becomes reflecting surface. If the exterior of a curvature of hollow sphere is coated in such a way that the interior (or cave part) of the surface behaves as reflecting surface then it is called a concave mirror . If the interior of the sphere is coated in such a way that the exterior (or vex part) behaves as a reflecting surface then it is called a convex mirror as shown in .                   The center of a sphere of which a mirror is a part is called a center of curvature, C . An imaginary line passing through the center of curvature of a spherical mirror is called the principal axis or optical axis of the mirror. Principle axis is a symmetrical line of the mirror. The point on the surface of mirror through which a principle axis is passing is called a pole, P or vertex of the mirror. The radius of a sphere of which a mirror is a part is called the radius of curvature, R of the mirror. Radius of curvature is a distance between pole of the mirror to the center of curvature of the mirror.                   The point on the principle axis through which the reflected rays of all the incident rays prallel to the principle axis must pass or appear to diverge from is called a focus, F and the distance between the pole and the focus is called a focal length, f of the mirror as shown in and . The size of the mirror is called the aperture of the mirror. If the aperture of a mirror is small then reflected rays of any beam parallel to the principle axis either must pass through or appear to diverge from the focus of the the mirror. In the case of a mirror of large aperture these reflected rays fail to meet at a single focus point, such inability of a mirror to focus all the reflected rays of a parallel incident beam at a single point is called geometrical or spherical aberration of the mirror. The light rays that lie close to the principal axis are called paraxial rays and they only able to meet at a single focus after reflection from the mirror. The rays that lie far from the principal axis are called marginal rays and after reflection they cross the principle axis before focus point. Hence, the reflection of large beam of light from the spherical mirror of large aperture creates a curved shape of light called a caustic curve as shown in . The cusp of caustic curves lie at the focus of the mirror. Spherical aberration can be minimized by using a mirror of small aperture which is smaller compared to its radius of curvature. Parabolic mirror will also minimize such spherical aberration.    Relation between f and R    Consider a concave mirror of small aperture and the incoming parallel ray is close to the principal axis so that angle of incidence i is small. Hence and are approximately right angled triangles with the same opposite side AB.      From   an alternate angle.] but from  exterior angle is sum of non-adjacent interior angles and law of reflection.    Similarly, we can obtain the relation for convex mirror as .    Sign Rules: Since focus and center of curvature lie behind the convex mirror the following sign conventions will be helpful in analyzing the nature of image formation by the spherical mirrors.  All distance will be measured from pole of the mirror;  Radius of curvature and focal length of concave mirror are assumed to be positive and that for convex mirror are negative; and  Distance for real object or real image is taken as positive and that for imaginary object or image is taken as negative.     Note: The distance between object and pole of the mirror is called object distance and that between image and pole of the mirror is called image distance .     Mirror Formula  An expression which shows the relation between object distance, image distance, and focal length of a mirror is called the mirror formula. To derive the formula following assumptions will be made. The aperture of the mirror is small and the object should be placed on the principal axis.               Let an object AB is placed on the principle axis as shown in . Consider a ray of light BM incident on the mirror parallel to the principle axis and after reflection passes through the focus F and goes along FB'. Another ray from B passes through the focus F, incident on the mirror at N and after reflection meets FB' at B'. So that A'B' is the real image of the object AB. Draw perpendicular from points M and N on the principle axis. Now, from similar and  In similar triangles the ratio of corresponding sides are equal.   here and are size of object, size of image, object distance, and image distance, respectively. Again, from similar and   From eqns. and , we get -  Divide both sides by , we get - We can obtain the similar formula for convex mirror with the help of . From similar and  From similar and   Substituting and solving the above expression, we get -     Lateral Magnification, m  The ratio of the size of image to the size of object is known as a magnification, Negative sign indicates inverted image.    Formation of Image by a Concave Mirror      When object lies at infinity: Consider a parallel beam of light coming from an object O at infinity incident on the mirror and after reflection converges on a focal plane to form an image I as shown in . The image is formed at focus and will be real, inverted, and point in size. Using mirror formula, if then , hence real, point in size, (as ) and inverted.         When object lies beyond center of curvature: Consider a ray of light BM is incident on the mirror parallel to the principle axis then after reflection it passes through F along MB'. Another ray BN incident on the mirror through F and meet to MB' at B' to form an image AB' as shown in . From geometry of the figure the image is formed between focus and center of curvature, inverted, real, and smaller in size.         When object lies at center of curvature: From geometry of the , the image is formed at C, inverted, real, and equal in size. Mirror formula . If , and .         When object lies between F and C: From geometry of the , the image is formed beyond C, inverted, real, and magnified.         When object lies at F: From geometry of the , the image is formed at infinity, inverted, real, and highly magnified.         When object lies between F and P: From geometry of the , the image is formed behind the mirror, erect, virtual, and magnified.           Formation of Image by a Convex Mirror      When object lies at infinity: From geometry of the , the image is formed behind the mirror at F, erect, virtual, and highly diminished.         When object lies on the Principle axis: From geometry of the , the image is formed behind the mirror between F and P, erect, virtual, and diminished.          "

  "title": "Refraction",
  "body": " Refraction   The phenomenon of bending of light ray as it goes from one medium to another is called a refraction. The velocity of light depends on the medium it is propagating which causes the refraction. The measure of an obstacle that a medium imposes on the velocity of light is known as refractive index of that medium. Hence the light ray bend as it goes from a medium of lower refractive index to the higher one or vice a versa.      If c is a velocity of light in a vacuum and v is the velocity of light in a given medium then the refractive index of this medium is defined as Medium with higher refractive index is known as optically denser medium and that with lower refractive index is known as optically rare medium .   Note: Optically denser and rare has nothing to do with the density of the medium which is sometimes misunderstood. However, refractive index of a medium is proportional to the density of that medium. As the temperature increases the density of the medium decreases generally and so is its refractive index. For example, water has density of and refractive index of whereas isopropyle alcohol has density of and refractive index of it means light bend more in alcohol then in water. The refractive index of vacuum is 1 and that for air is 1.0003 hence they are taken as same. When a ray is incident on the surface separating two media it either bends towards or away from the normal at the point of incidence. If light goes from rare to denser it bends towards the normal and if it goes from denser to rare it bends away from the normal. The angle between initial direction of light to the final direction in the second medium is known as angle of deviation, .   Refraction of a plane wavefront at a plane surface:   Let MN be the surface separating two media a and b having refracting indices of and ,respectively as shown in . Let velocity of light in medium a is and medium b is where . Consider a plane wavefront APB is coming to incident on plane MN. By the time the disturbance at B reaches to C, the secondary waves from A must have traveled a distance where t is the time taken by the waves to travel the distance BC. As velocity of light is less in medium b, the refracted wavefront is given by the tangent CD drawn at point D, where AD is a radius of sphere centered at point A. The line CD happens to be an envelop of all the secondary wavelets of wavefront APB coming from medium a to medium b.      From the and  Similarly, from and    From eqns. and , we get -  Hence, if AD is the radius of the secondary wavefront for the point A, then QS is the radius of the secondary wavefront for the point Q. Let i and r be the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively then from and    From the definition of rare and denser medium, . This is the Snell's law.  If then that is the refracted ray bent towards the normal. If then that is the refracted ray bent away from the normal.    Laws of Refraction  The laws of refraction state that  The incident ray, the normal at the point of incidence, and the refracted ray are coplanar;  The ratio of sine of the angles of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of refractive indices of the second and first medium, i.e.   where and are absolute refractive index of first and second medium, respectively. An absolute refractive index is the measure of refractive index of the medium with respect to air or vacuum. is read as refractive index of a second medium with respect to the first.  The second law is also known as Snell's law , which is     Real and Apparent Depth   A plane interface between two transparent media is a special surface of spherical refracting surface with infinite radius of curvature. When objects are seen under a transparent medium like water they appear closer than they really are. This is the effect of refraction and hence it is used to determine the refractive index of the transparent medium. The refraction produces a virtual image of an object above its real position.      Suppose an object O is lying at a depth t below an optically denser medium such as water. A ray of light OC is incident on interface normally and passes along CD without any deviation. Another ray of light OA incident at an on the interface and refracted along AE at an . For a small aperture of eye points A and C are very close to each other and once the rays AE and CD reach to the eye then object appears at point I which is a virtual image of object O. Here in , the rays AE and BF are constituting the virtual image $I$ of the object O. Actually in geometrical optics, to see an image of any object at least two rays emanating from the object after reflection or refraction must reach to the oberserver's eye.  From , alternating angles and , corresponding angles. Therefore from Snell's law  where is absolute refractive index of water (denser medium) and is absolute refractive index of air (rare medium). Since the aperture of eye is very small points A and C are considered very close to each other and hence and are very small, i.e., and .    Hence the apparent shift, d of the object to be appered is given by where is the real depth of the object and is a refractive index of medium b with respect to medium a.   Apparent shift under a number of transparent media:       When an object lies under a number of transparent media [ ] then its apparent shift can be determined by Where and are the apparent shift of the object in a medium of refractive index and , respectively.    Lateral Shift  When a ray of light is incident obliquely on a parallel sided transparent medium such as glass slab, then the emergent ray shifts laterally. The perpendicular distance between the direction of the incident ray and the emergent ray is called a lateral shift .      In the given figure, d is a lateral shift, BD is an emergent ray, and is a thickness of the glass slab. From ,   But from ,   Hence from eqns. and , we get -     Principle of Reversibility of Light      The principle of reversibility of light states that if the path of light is reversed even after suffering from the number of reflections and refractions, it retraces its original path.  From the principle of reversibility -  Multiplying them we get-    "

  "title": "Total Internal Reflection",
  "body": " Total Internal Reflection   When a ray of light passes from an optically denser medium to the rare medium it bends away from the normal. If the angle of incidence in this case is increased gradually then at particular angle of incidence the refracted ray starts grazing on the surface separating two media i.e., angle of refraction becomes . The angle of incidence at that condition is called a critical angle, c . If the angle of incidence is further increased above the critical angle then the light ray returns into the same denser medium, such phenomenon is called the total internal reflection . Since the reflection happen at a very top thin surface of interface and it is assumed that there is no loss of energy in the form of transmission or absorption, hence the name total internal reflection. Starting from angle of incidence angle of refraction as i increases r also increases if the ray of light is going from denser to a rare medium as shown in . When (the critical angle) then the angle of refraction, . Hence from Snell's law          Now once the the refracted ray disappears and appears as a reflected ray in the same medium, b and obeys all the laws of reflection.  This phenomenon is very useful in sending the light signal through an optical fiber, and changing the direction of ray of light using prism. Rainbow, mirage, and sparkling of diamond can be possible due to total internal reflection.    Mirage  It is an optical illusion which gives the deceptive appearance of image of a distant object as it is formed in a pool of water. Mirage is caused by refraction of the light rays in layers of air of varying density. In a hot summer day in a desert or on a highway layers of varying density of air is formed because of heat. Layer of air near the surface of earth is hotter than it is above the surface of earth.                   Colder air above the earth behaves as a denser medium and hotter air near the earth surface behaves as rare medium. Now when a light ray coming from a tall distant object passes through a denser to a rare medium keep bending away from normal and when angle of incidence becomes greater than the critical angle it gets total internal reflection. When this ray falls on the observer's eye it appears to come from an inverted image of that tall object which deceives the observer's that there may be a puddle of water near the tall object as shown in .  On the other hand, in a cold winter days near the sea-shore an inverted or upright image of an object such as a boat can be seen hanging in the sky. This is all because of the bending of light. When the virtual image of an object over a body of water, due to a cool, dense layers of air is seen then it is called a looming as shown in . Thus, an object like a boat below the horizon which is not visible directly, will be seen apparently lifted into the sky.  When a strong inversion layer extends upwards from the surface of a body of water an enhanced bending of light happen and an object appears to be suspended in the air. On the other hand, when the bottom of the inversion layer is some distance above the water and the observer is slightly below the inversion layer as shown in , the observer sees the object hanging inverted in the sky called superior mirage .

If a prism ABC is rotated about a point P in such a way that angle of incidence increases gradually,then the angle of deviation, start decreasing initially obtains the minimum value and then start increasing again. The condition at which angle of deviation becomes minimum is called the angle of minimum deviation, and it is a very special case in prism. At the refracted ray inside the prism is parallel to the base of the prism, and hence angle of incidence, i = angle of emergence, e. This condition is useful to determine the refractive index of the material of the prism.  For a prism ABC, use Snell's law on face AB where is refractive index of medium g (glass) with respect to a (air). Now from , we have -   [ exterior angle of a triangle is equal to sum of the non-adjacent interior angles.]  Also from triangle,  and from quadrilateral,         From eqns. and , we get - Now from eqns. and , we get - But at minimum deviation condition, we have -     Now from , we have- This is the relation between refractive index and angle of minimum deviation.  If the angle of a prism is less than then the prism is called a thin prism . In thin prism, A is very small and for small i, r, and e are also very small, hence we have - [ for small ] where , the absolute refractive index of glass.  "

  "title": "Thin Lenses",
  "body": " Thin Lenses   A lens is a part of solid spherical refracting surfaces. If its thickness is very thin it is called a thin lens. It is mainly of two types, concave lens and convex lens. The property of lens depends upon its shape and the type of material it is made up off. The lens which consists of two inward curved surfaces is known as concave lens and that which consists of two outward bulged surfaces is known as convex lens . However the combination of types of surfaces gives a lens different shapes. In are biconvex lens, plano-convex lens, concavo-convex lens, biconcave lens, plano-concavelens, and convexo-concave lens, respectively. Convex lenses are thicker at the middle and thinner at the edges and concave lenses are thinner at the middle and thicker at the edges.                               Anatomy of lenses are shown in . An imaginary line that bisects the symmetrical lens into two halves is known as vertical axis . The center of sphere of which a surface of lens is a part is known as center of curvature . There are two faces in a lens so it has two centers of curvature, . An imaginary straight line that is passing through the geometrical centre of a lens and joining the two centres of curvature of its surfaces is known as optical axis or principle axis. The light ray passing along this axis is perpendicular to the surfaces and will not deviate. All other rays passing through a lens and its optical center are called secondary axes. The geometric center of a lens is called an optical center of lens. The light ray passing through the optical center will never deviate.               The beam of light incident parallel to the principal axis will converge when passing through a convex lens, and diverge when passing through a concave lens. Since the convex lens converges the incident light rays it is also known as converging lens and the concave lens diverges the incident light rays it is also known as diverging lens ( and ). In a lens it is convenient to take 2F points on the principle axis on both sides of the lens to draw ray diagram. It is just double the focal length of the lens but not the center of curvature.               The point on the principle axis where the incident light rays parallel to the principle axis after refraction from the lens will converge on or appear to diverge from is known as focus or focal point of a lens. Two foci exist in a lens, equidistant on either side of the lens, since light behaves the same way when traveling in either direction (Principle of Reversibility). The two foci, and are called the primary principal focus and the secondary principal focus, respectively. An imaginary plane that is perpendicular to the principal axis at the focal point is known as focal plane . The size of a lens is known as aperture . The distance between the optical center, O to the center of curvature is known as radius of curvature, R and the distance between optical center, O to the focal point of a lens is known as focal length, f . The focal length, f is taken as positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. The radius of curvature, R is positive for convex surface and negative for concave surface. The shape of surface can be defined from which surface is the light incident.               A lens can be thought of as made up of a number of truncated prisms of varying refracting angle pile on top of each other on both sides. The refracting angle of a prism at the middle portion is infinite hence it behaves like a simple glass slab. The refracting angles of the prisms above or below the middle section of the lens gradually increase positively for convex lens and negatively for concave lens as shown in and . Since the prism bends the ray of light towards its base light converges in convex lens and diverges in concave lens after passing through the lens.    Lens Formula  Ray diagrams provide the nature of the image formed by the lens for an object placed at different distances from the lens but it can not provide the numerical information about image distance and its size. Hence the lens formula is very useful in determining the numerical relationship between the object distance, s, the image distance, s', and the focal length, f of a lens. From right angled and [ and ],                   Here y, y', s, s' are size of object, size of image, object distance, and image distance, respectively. Now from right angled and , we have -    From eqns. and , we get - Dividing by ss'f on both sides, we get- Which is a lens formula. The lateral magnification produced by the lens is given by -ve sign indicates an inverted image.  The following sign conventions are used for lens formula. All the distances are measured from the optical center of a lens. The distance for real object or real image is taken as positive and the distance for virtual object or virtual image is taken as negative. The focal length and radius of curvature of a convex lens are taken as positive and that for concave lens are taken as negative.                Alternative: A thin lens is a combination of a number of thin prisms and as a refracting angle, A of a prism at the point of incidence of a ray in the lens is same, the angle of deviation is given as which is constant irrespective of the angle of incidence for a ray incident on the lens. Now suppose a ray is incident at a height, h on a lens and produce a deviation . Hence from a we have - Also from , For a thin lens, is small, hence are and .       Image formed by a convex lens      When object lies at infinity: When object lies at infinity rays of light coming from the object considered as parallel beam of light and must converge at the focal plane after refraction through the lens. Hence the image is formed at focal plane, will be real, inverted, and point in size ( ).         When object lies beyond 2F: The ray parallel to the principle axis after refraction from the lens passes through the point F and the ray passes through the optical center goes without deviation. When both these refracted rays meet each other image is formed. Hence, the image is formed between F and 2F on the other side of the lens, will be real, inverted, and smaller in size ( ).         When object lies at 2F: The image is formed at 2F on the other side of the lens, will be real, inverted, and equal in size ( ).         When object lies between F and 2F: The image is formed beyond 2F on the other side of the lens, will be real, inverted, and larger in size ( ).         When object lies at F: The image is formed at infinity on the other side of the lens, will be real, inverted, and highly magnified ( ).         When object lies between focus, F and optical center, C: The image is formed at the same side of the object, will be virtual, errect, and magnified ( ).           Image formed by a concave lens   When object lies at principle axis: The image is formed between F and C at the same side of the object, will be virtual, errect, and diminished ( ).       "

In other words, the inability of a lens to focus all colors of white light at a single focus is known as chromatic aberration. From lens maker's formula it is clear that the focal length of a lens depend upon the refractive index of a material of lens which is the cause of chromatic aberration. If white light is passing through the lens violet color focuses at a point near to the lens and the red color focuses at point far from the lens. The rays of intermediate colors are focused between these points as shown in . Hence the image of an object emitting white light stretched between and and is blurred. Chromatic aberration is of two types, axial (or longitudinal) aberration and lateral (or transverse) aberration.                   The axial chromatic aberration is given by Now the focal length of a lens is given by    Hence  Taking as f is a geometrical mean of and and being the focal length of mean light, we have - Hence it is clear that a single lens can not produce an image free from chromatic aberration unless the dispersive power can be balanced by using some other material.    Achromatism  The condition of removing chromatic aberration from a lens is called an achromatism.

  "title": "Rainbow",
  "body": " Rainbow   A rainbow is an optical phenomenon, which is produced in the sky due to the combined effect of refraction, internal reflection, and dispersion of light in water droplets. A rainbow consists of the primary rainbow and the secondary rainbow. The primary (main) rainbow is caused by two refractions and one internal reflection inside a rain droplet. The secondary rainbow appears outside the primary one and is caused by two refractions and two internal reflections inside the spherical water droplet. The colors of the secondary rainbow are reversed from the primary bow, and the secondary bow is twice as broad.               A rainbow can be seen in the sky when an observer facing opposite to the sun look at about above the horizon to suspended water droplets. Each individual droplet of water acts as a tiny prism that both disperses the light and reflects it back to the observer's eye. As you sight into the sky, wavelengths of light associated with a specific color arrive at your eye from the collection of droplets as shown in . The net effect of the vast array of droplets is that a circular arc of VIBGYOR is seen across the sky. A rainbow is actually a complete circle but observers on the ground only view the top half of the circle since the bottom half of the circular arc is prevented by the presence of the ground. However, observers in an airborne plane can view the complete circular bow. Rainbows are not limited to the dispersion of light by raindrops. The splashing of water in front of you forms water mist in the air and if you are facing opposite to the sun then the chances are you can create your own rainbows. Bright sunlight, suspended water droplets and the proper angle of sighting are the three necessary components for viewing one of nature's most spectacular activities.    Primary Rainbow  Consider a ray AP from the sun is incident at point P in a spherical water droplet and refracts along PQ. If the angle of incidence of ray PQ at point P is greater than the critical angle for water air interface then light gets internally reflected along QR from the back surface of drop and may emerge into the air at the point R as shown in . During this operation the deviation suffered by the ray of light is given by the , since the line MO is parallel to the incident ray AP and line ON is parallel to the emergent ray RB. Note that the absorption, reflection, and refraction happen in light at each point it strikes on the surface of droplet. From figure at left,         Using Snell's law at point P, we have -  where for air and the refractive index of water.   Now from eqn. , we get - A rainbow will form when the angle of deviation is maximum for the given angle of incidence i, i.e., when . If this condition is satisfied, all the rays with incident angle close to will be sent back in the same direction, producing a bright zone in the sky.  Differentiating eqn. w.r.t. and set that to zero, we get -           Since for red light, angle of incidence at maximum deviation is given by   Also for violet light,         That is, the different colors of light correspond to different wavelengths of light, which are refracted at slightly different angles, thus splitting the white sunlight into red and violet lights. The color of the primary rainbow are spread over about out of the away from the anti-solar point as shown in . The viewer sees the rainbow with the red at the outer side of the arc and the violet on the inner side. Our perception of vision for violet light is not that sensitive hence, we see blue light more clearly than violet light. It is to be remembered that sunlight strikes the raindrops at different angles of incidence and undergoes different deviations. Only those rays produce a rainbow which have the angle of incidence corresponding to maximum angles of deviation.    Secondary Rainbow  In secondary rainbow, there are two reflections and two refractions. From f the total deviation   Now for minimum deviation             using eqn.    Taking refractive index of water for red light, angle of deviation, The acute angle Taking refractive index of water for violet light, angle of deviation, The acute angle Hence, the angle of inclination for violet light is more than for red light.

  "body": " Scattering  It is a phenomenon of absorption and reemition of light energy in different directions when it interacts with material particles. The intensity of scattered light depends on the size of interacting particles, a and the wavelength of light,       If , than the amount of light scattered is given by When sunlight interacts with atmospheric particles, blue colors scattered more in sky than any other colors from the visible spectrum of light, hence, the sky looks bluish in color. In fact, violet light scattered more than blue but our eyes are more sensitive to blue color than violet light hence blue colors are much more prevailed than others in sky. At sunset and sunrise, the sunlight has to travel longer distance in the atmosphere which causes most of the blue and other shorter wavelengths are scattered in the sky and only red color is able to reach to our eyes hence, the sun appears reddish in color. The wavelength of constituent colors of white light is shown in .  If the size of interacting particle, , then all the colors of light scattered equally and no any specific color is dominant. This is the reason when sunlight interacts with water droplets or clouds in sky they appear white rather than any other color.  "

  "body": " Optical Vision   Eye is an optical device endowed to us to perceive the beautiful nature. It is nearly spherical in shape of diameter about 2.3 cm. The front portion of eye is slightly bulges out and is covered with transparent tough membrane called cornea . Behind cornea it has liquid called aqueous humor . Next to it is a diaphragm called iris with a hole at its center called pupi l. Behind iris there is a crystalline lens which is mounted on a ciliary muscles . Inside eye ball is filled with liquid called vitreous humor . The image is formed on the innermost light sensitive membrane called retina . The pupil is just like a shutter in camera which allow the sufficient amount of light to enter into the eye. The pupil takes sometime to readjust its size to allow how much light permits to enter the eye, this is the reason when you go from sunny day outside to the relatively dark room like cinema hall nothing is visible for a while but gradually everything becomes clear after sometime.      Once the light from objects falls on the retina after getting refracted from the crystalline lens and vitrous humor, retina changes the light signal into electrical signal and transmits this signal to the brain via optic nerve where brain realizes the image of the object. The eye lens is designed in such a way that it forms the image of object situated at different distances from the eye. The mechanism of crystalline lens to focus the light coming from objects at different distance to the retina is called an accommodation . When object is near to the eye its focal length has to be smaller and lens has to be thicker to focus the light on retina and when an object is very far away from the eye lens, then its focal length has to be longer and lens has to be thinner to focus the light onto retina.               A healthy human eye can see objects clearly as close as 25 cm from the eye. This distance is called a least distance of distinct vision, D and the point is called a near point N as shown in . A far point for healthy human eye is considered at infinity as shown in . If there exists any problem in the accommodation process, then the eyes are called suffering from defects of vision. For example, if the ciliary muscles do not contract or stretch as it supposed to be then our eye unable to focus the light at retina to privide clear vision. There are many other reasons which may be responsible for defects of vision. The common two types of defects of vision, myopia (short sightedness) and hypermetropia (far sightedness) are being discussed here.    Myopia:  In this defect, objects far from eye appear blurred and that near eye appears clear. When objects lie near eye eyelens can contract to become thicker and achieve shorter focal length to produce image of near objects at retina and hence objects appeared clear. When objects are far from eye eyelens cannot stretch to become sufficiently thinner and achieve longer focal length to produce image of such objects on retina and hence it forms image in front of retina as shown in . Actually, when objects lie anywhere between new far point F and near point N, eye can accommodate itself for clear vision but produces image in front of retina to any objects farther than point F. To correct myopic eye a concave lens of suitable focal length can be used as shown in .               A suitable concave lens diverges the incoming light rays from the object at infinity in such a way that the eyelens converges them to the retina. Hence a virtual image of the object is formed at new far point. Here and from lens formula the focal length of concave lens is given as   The power of a lens is defined as and its SI unit is diopter (D).    Hypermetropia (or hyperopia):  In this defect, objects far from eye appear clear and that near eye appears blurred. When objects are far from eye eyelens can stretch enough to become sufficiently thinner and achieve longer focal length to produce image on retina. When objects lie near eye eyelens cannot contract enough to become thicker and achieve shorter focal length to produce image at retina and hence the image is formed behind the retina as shown in . Actually, when objects lie anywhere between infinity to new near point N' eye can accommodate itself for clear vision but produces image behind the retina to any objects near than point N'. To correct myopic eye a convex lens of suitable focal length can be used as shown in .               A suitable convex lens converges the incoming light rays from the object at near point N in such a way that the eyelens converges them further to the retina. Hence a virtual image of the object is formed at new near point N'. Here and from lens formula the focal length of convex lens is given as   The power of a lens is defined as     Visual Angle  Angle subtended by an object on the eye is known as visual angle. The size of the image formed at retina is proportional to the visual angle. Higher the visual angle larger the apparent size of the object. Consider objects and of different sizes are situated at different distance from the eye but they subtend the same visual angle, then size of their images formed on the retina will be equal. Hence they appeared to be of same size.      On the other hand, suppose two objects and of the same size situated at different distances from the eye, but the object subtends the visual angle and the object subtends the visual angle such that then the apparent size of looks larger then that of the object .  If a is the distance of retina from the eye lens and b is the size of image on retina, then from , we have -   Since the diameter of eye ball, a is constant for a given eye. Optical instruments are used to increase the visual angle to observe objects clearly.    Angular Magnification (or Magnifying Power:)  Optical instruments such as microscope and telescope are designed to increase the visual angle so that the object viewed through them can be made to appear larger than its original size. Therefore the angular magnification, M of an instrument is the ratio of the visual anlge subtended by the final image at the eye to the visual angle subtended by the object itself at the eye without the use of instrument. Suppose is the visual angle subtends by the object on eye when viewed directly without the aid of an optical instrument and is the angle subtends by the final image of the object on eye when viewed with the help of the instrument, then   There are two positions in optical instruments where final image has been produced to observe. When the final image is produced at the position where it is expected to see clearly is called normal adjustment . For a simple or compound microscope normal adjustment is the position when final image is formed at the least distance of distinct vision but for telescope normal adjustment is the position of obtaining the final image at infinity. For the object which is at a far distance and very small we want to see its big image and hence telescope is set normally to see the final image at infinity. For the object which is near but extremely small we want to see it very distinctly and highly resolved hence microscope is used to form the final image of objects at our near point of clear vision which is about 25 cm from eye.

It is of mainly two types, simple microscope and compound microscope.    Simple Microscope     When final image is formed at a least distance of distinct vision, D ( Normal Adjustment ):      A magnifying glass or a hand lens is called a simple microscope. It is a convex lens of short focal length. When an object is placed between F and optical center C of the lens its virtual image is formed at the same side of the object and is magnified. Suppose an object AB subtends an angle on eye when it is at a least distance of distinct vision, D so that Now when object is placed between F and C of the convex lens and final image is formed at the least distance of distinct vision, then Dividing eqn. by , we get -  for small angles.   but  for a lens.

Compound Microscope  Angular magnification of microscope, , so we can increase the magnification by reducing the focal length of the lens but there is a limitation to decrease the focal length. Short focal length needs large curvature of the surface and hence the small field of view. Therefore, two separate convex lenses are used to increase the magnifying power. The lens near the eye is called an eyepiece and has high focal length and large aperture. The lens near the object is called an objective and has low focal length and small aperture. The aperture of eyepiece is larger because of the size of eye is larger than the size of object.     When final image is formed at a least distance of distinct vision, D ( Normal Adjustment ):      In this case object is placed very close to the focus of objective such that it forms an enlarged and real image of the object between focus and optical center of eyepiece.

Astronomical Telescope  Astronomical telescope is used to see celestial objects. It consists of two convex lenses one which faces the object is called objective and another is near the eye called eyepiece. Objective has large aperture (to collect sufficient amount of light to produce clear image) and has large focal length. The eyepice has small aperture (to match the size of eye) and short focal length.     When final image is formed at infinity ( Normal Adjustment ):      In this case real image A'B' of the object at infinity is obtained at the focal plane of the objective. The eyepiece is so adjusted that this image behaves like a real object of eyepiece situated at its focus which produces the final image at infinity as shown in .

  "body": " Photometry   The branch of optics which deals with the measurement of light energy is called photometry. Light is either reflected by the object or is emitted by it. Most of the objects are seen when it reflects light, such as wall, book, moon, etc. Objects like lamp, stars, sun, etc. can be seen when it emits its own light. To protect eye from light strain, some standard of illumination must be set. Hence, it is necessary to measure the quantity of light emitted by a source as well as the amount of light reflecting from some surface. The classroom illumination of 250 lumens per square meter (or, lux) should be preferable, whereas operation theater should be preferable to about 1000 lumens per square meter (or, lux).    Standard Candle  A standard candle is made out of sperm wax weighing 1\/6 pound, 7\/8 inch in diameter, 4.5 cm in height, and it burns at the rate of 120 grains per hour. It was taken as a standard unit of illuminating power of a source in early days. If the source gives off light 60 times as the light given out by a standard candle then its power is taken as 60 candle power. However, such measurement cannot be used in scientific work as the power of candle depends on the shape of wick, size of flame during different seasons. With the advancement in science standard of light has been defined in terms of blackbody radiation. International unit of Luminous intensity (or, Illuminating power) of source is taken as candela. One candela is 1\/60 of the light luminosity coming out of a hole of area of a hollow cavity acting as a black body radiator maintained at the freezing point ( ) of platinum.    Solid Angle,  It is an angle subtends by any object at a point. It is defined as the ratio of surface area of an object to the square of distance of object from the point at which solid angle is being subtended.       where S is the surface area of the object perpendicular to the rays subtending the angle at the point and r is the distance of object from the point. If S is oblique to r then, Its SI unit is steradian (st.rad.).    Luminous Flux,  The amount of light which flows from a source in one second is known as luminous flux. It is only that part of total radiant energy which is visible and affect the eye. Its SI unit is Lumen. Lumen is defined as luminous flux per unit solid angle due to a point source of one candela.  Let a point source of light of one candela at the center of an imaginary sphere of radius r. Suppose the total luminous flux = , the total solid angle subtends at the center of sphere by the entire surface area of the sphere,   Lumen is also defined as the flow of light energy per second through 1 square meter of a source of 1 m radius, where a source of 1 candela is placed at the center of curvature.

For example,   The brightness of a white chalk on the blackboard is very high as compared to the black polish on the board, but the intensity of illumination of the white chalk and black polish is the same.    If the two opposite walls of a room are painted with white paint and red paint, respectively then the wall with white paint appears brighter than the red wall. However, the intensity of illumination of both the walls is same as the amount of luminous flux per square cm incident on each wall is the same.   Due to these reasons, the brightness of a surface is defined as the luminous flux per sq. cm. coming out of the surface after reflection. If I is the intensity of illumination and R is the reflecting power of the surface, then the brightness of the surface = RI.    Bunsen's Grease Spot Photometer  This photometer is used to compare the luminous intensities of the two sources or to calculate the luminous intensity of the unknown source by comparing that with the known source. It consists of a piece of white paper with grease spot at its center lies in between the two sources whose luminous intensities are to be compared.

  "title": "Interference",
  "body": " Interference   When two or more waves interact simultaneously at any particle in a medium, the resultant displacement of the particle at that instant is given by the superposition of all these waves. After the superposition from the region of overlapping these waves emerge as if they have not interfered at all. Each wave retains its individual characteristics and behaves as if others were not there. This behavior is known as principle of superposition . The principle of superposition states that when two or more waves meet at a point, the total displacement is the vector sum of the displacements that each individual wave would cause at that point.      The phenomenon of overlapping of two or more waves at a point in space is called an interference . Suppose two waves of same amplitudes and frequencies superimpose on each other at a point (in same phase) in such a way that the crest of one falls on the crest of the other or the trough of one falls on the trough of the other then the amplitude of the particle is twice the amplitude of either of the waves. At these points, the waves reinforce with each other. If they superimpose in (opposite phase) such a way that the crest of one falls on the trough of the other then the amplitude is zero. At these points, the waves cancel out the displacement of the particle due to each other. It is possible that in some region of space the energy is more than the energy due to individual waves and in some other region, it is less than that due to individual waves. Hence, the phenomenon of redistribution of energy due to superposition of waves is also termed as interference . This redistribution of energy depends upon the frequency, amplitude, and the phases of individual waves. It should be remembered that there is no loss of energy due to interference. Since intensity is proportional to square of amplitude, the intensity at a maximum displacement is four times than the intensity due to one of the waves. The interference with maximum intensity or maximum amplitude is known as constructive interference and those with minimum intensity or minimum amplitude is known as destructive interference . The interference phenomenon was first demonstrated clearly in Young's experiment in 1802.  A sunlight is allowed to pass through a pinhole S and then at some distance away on two other pinholes and as shown in . and are equidistant from S and are very close to each other. When a spherical wavefront from S reaches to and it distributed into two separate wavefronts of identical in nature (Huygen's principle). When these wavefronts superimpose to each other on the screen dark and bright bands can be observed clearly. The point such as O on the screen is bright because the crest of one wave falls on the crest of another (or trough of one falls on the trough of the other). Hence they reinforce each other. The points such as P are dark because the crest of one wave falls on the trough of the other wave and they neutralize the effect of each other.    Coherent Sources  It is not possible to have interference due to two independent sources of light because they are not similar to each other and can not maintain a constant phase difference. To have a sustained interference the two waves must be coherent (i.e., they have same wavelength, amplitude, and in a constant phase difference), and must be moving nearly parallel to each other. Since the wavelength of light is extremely small (of the order of ), the two sources must be narrow and very close to each other.  Two wave sources are said to be coherent if they emit light waves of same frequency (i.e. same wavelength), same amplitude, and in a constant phase difference with each other. In practice, it is not possible to have two independent sources which are coherent. A source of light consists of a large number of atoms and light pulse is emitted when an electron from higher energy levels falls onto a lower energy levels in an excited atom. The emission of light pulse from various atoms is random and hence such light pulses do not have constant phase relationship.               For sustained interference the superposing waves must be in constant phase difference which can be achieved through the following two methods called wavefront division or amplitude division. In wavefront division very narrow slits are taken help to divide the wavefront and form two virtual sources. According to Huygens principle every points on a wavefront behave as secondary sources that are vibrating in phase. Therefore portions of wave front cut by holes (or slits) are coherent sources and waves emitted by them are also coherent as shown in .  In amplitude division coherent sources are formed by dividing the amplitude of wave by multiple reflection and refraction by a thin transparent film. A ray of light gets partly reflected as ray and partly refracted when incident on a thin transparent film. At the point of incidence the refracted ray is again partly reflected and emerges out from the upper surface as ray . At every stage of reflection and refraction the intensity of light decreases. Now, intensity is proportional to square of amplitude hence at each stage amplitude is divided. Since, both rays have been obtained from a single ray, they are coherent as shown in .    Phase Difference and Path Difference  If the path difference between the two waves is , the phase difference between them is . Therefore if the path difference is x, then their phase difference, would be given by    "

Hook was able to develop interference fringes through mica sheet and Newton was able to develop interference fringes in the gap between a convex lens and a plane glass plate. Young was able to explain these phenomena on the basis of interference between light reflected from the top and bottom surface of a thin film. It has been observed that interference in the case of thin film takes place due to  reflected light and  transmitted light.                   Interference due to Reflected Light in Thin Films  In amplitude division method to obtain coherent sources, amplitude of the reflected waves at each interface decreases gradually, hence only the first reflection from each interface is considered for interference fringes.

When it does, it reflects inverted because it was moving from less dense air to more dense soap film. Most of the light energy transmitted into the soap film where a small part of it reflects off again from the bottom surface of the soap film. This time, the wave reflects unchanged because it was going from more dense soap film to less dense air. When this wave energy transmits back into the air, it is out-of-phase with the wave that is reflecting off the top surface. This means that a crest of one matches up with a trough of the other. Interference of waves tells us that they will cancel each other out at this point. The overall effect is that some of the colors in the original white light disappear altogether, leaving other colors behind. These are the colors you see in soap bubbles.  When white light is incident on a thin film, the reflected light rays which satisfies the condition will not include any color. Therefore, the film appears colored and the color will depend upon the thickness and the angle of inclination [ ]. If r and t are constant, the color will be uniform.

  "title": "Diffraction",
  "body": " Diffraction   We may have seen a geometrical shadow around the bright spot when the light coming through a hole falls on a screen. If the size of hole is decreased gradually, the brightness also spreads over the geometrical shadow region, which could not be explained on the basis of geometrical optics. Such phenomenon of bending of light around the corners of a narrow aperture or obstacle and spreading of light waves into geometrical shadow is called diffraction . It is also a superposition of two light waves just as in case of interference. The difference is that when two wavefronts from coherent sources are superimposed interference takes place but when two secondary wavelets of a same wavefront superimpose diffraction takes place. Hence two coherent sources are mandatory for interference pattern but only one source is sufficient enough to produce diffraction pattern. Thus diffraction is a superposition of two or more secondary wavelets. The diffraction phenomena can only be explained on the basis of wave theory of light.               Consider a monochromatic light from a source S is passing through samll aperture MN and falls on the screen XY. On the screen AB is a bright portion and the portion above point A and below point B is geometric shadow. From the rectilinear propagation of light the geometrical shadow region must be completely dark but we know that the there is an encroachment of light and shadow is no longer a complete dark rather darkness prevails more as we go further above A or below B as shown in . Similarly, if an opaque obstacle MN is placed in the path of light there should be illumination in the geometrical shadow region AB also as shown in . In order to see the illumination in a geometrical shadow the size of the obstacle must be comparable to the wavelength of light.  Light waves have very small wavelength from mto . If the size of opening or obstacle is near to this limit, then only diffraction takes place. Huygens wavelets theory with the help of principle of interference can explain satisfactorily the bending effect of light around the obstacles. Diffraction phenomena can be divided into two types: Fresnel diffraction and Fraunhofer diffraction . In Fresnel class, the source and the screen are taken at finite distances from the aperture or obstacle. In Fraunhofer class, the source and the screen are taken virtually at infinite distances from the aperture or obstacle. The incoming light is rendered parallel with a lens and the diffracted beam is focused on the screen with another lens. Fresnel diffraction does not require any lens. A plane wavefront is considered in Fraunhofer diffraction. We discuss here only Fraunhoffer type diffraction.    Single Slit Diffraction  To obtain a Fraunhoffer diffraction pattern, the incident wavefront must be plane and the diffracted light is collected on the screen with the help of a lens. To obtain a plane wavefront either the source is set at far away from the slit or a source is placed at a focus of a lens as shown in .      Let a parallel beam of monochromatic light be incident on a slit AB of width a. The secondary waves traveling in the same direction as the incident light come to focus at the point O and those traveling at an angle come to focus at P as shown in .               Consider a plane wavefront is incident on the slit AB and each point on this wavefront behaves as a source of secondary disturbance (Huygen's principle). The secondary waves (wavelets) from A and B reach the point O after traveling the equal distance and produce the central bright fringe. The path difference between the waves from A and B to point O is zero. Hence, the secondary waves reinforce each other at point O and the point O will be of maximum intensity.  Now consider the secondary waves from point A travel with the inclination reach the point P. All the secondary waves from slit when reach the point P then point P will be of maximum or minimum intensity depending on the path difference between them originating from the corresponding points of the wavefront on slit. Draw BL normal on BP, then from , where a is the width of the slit and BL is the path difference between secondary waves originating from points A and B. If , then point P will be a point of minimum intensity. To understand this concept divide the wavefront into two halves AC and BC and if the path difference between the secondary waves from A and B is , then path difference between the secondary waves from point A and C will be . Similarly from every point in the upper half AC there is a corresponding point in the lower half BC and the path difference between the secondary waves from these points is . Thus, destructive interference takes place and the point P will be of minimum intensity. If , then also the point where they meet on the screen will be of minimum intensity. To understand this concept the wavefront AB now can be divided into four quarters. The secondary waves from first quarter meet on that from second quarter on screen in opposite phase, i.e. in path difference and cancel out each other. Hence the point on screen will be of minimum intensity. In general for secondary minima   where gives the direction of minimum, here . If, however, the path difference is odd multiple of , the direction of secondary maxima can be obtained. In this case, Thus, the diffraction pattern due to a single slit consists of a central bright maximum at O followed by secondary maxima and minima on both sides. All waves do not interfere constructively for this situation, and so the maximum is not as intense as the central maximum. The intensity distribution on the screen is given in . The secondary maxima are of much less intensity and the intensity also falls of rapidly from the point O outwards. From , we have  Therefore, the width of central maximum , i.e. no diffraction if width of slit, a is very large as becomes very small.     Intensity of Diffraction Pattern due to a Single Slit  Consider the center of the slit C as a origin of coordinates and the element of the wavefront at coordinate (0,z). The distance of the element from point P is .      The displacement at point P due to the waves coming from the element at any time is given by The resultant displacement at P due to the whole wavefront, From ,            Therefore the amplitude at P is and thus intensity at P is   we have For secondary maxima, from eqn. ,  Substituting , we have      For the first secondary maximum ,      For the second secondary maximum ,       Thus the secondary maxima are of decreasing intensity. For secondary minima, from eqn. ,  Substituting , we have . Therefore the intensity of secondary minima are given as    "

  "body": " Double Slits Diffraction   If the width of slit is very narrow such as , then in the double-slit experiment, the central maximum of the diffraction pattern of either slit covers the entire viewing screen and the interference of light produces bright fringes with approximately the same intensity. In practice, however, the condition is not met. For relatively wide slits , the interference of light from two slits produces bright fringes that do not all have the same intensity. That is, the intensities of the fringes produced by double-slit interference are modified by diffraction of the light passing through each slit.               The intensity of suggests the double-slit interference pattern that would occur if the slits were infinitely narrow; all the bright interference fringes would have the same intensity. The intensity plot of is that for diffraction by a single slit; the diffraction pattern has a broad central maximum and weaker secondary maxima. The plot of suggests the interference pattern for two actual slits. That plot was constructed by using the curve of as an envelope on the intensity plot in . The positions of the fringes are not changed; only the intensities are affected.  Double slit diffraction can be explained as a combination of  the interference pattern due to secondary waves coming from the corresponding points of the two slits and  the diffraction pattern due to the secondary waves from the two slits individually.            Interference maxima and minima: Consider the secondary waves traveling in direction with the initial direction of the incident light. Now from from  If the path difference CN is an odd multiple of , then gives the direction of minima due to interference of the secondary waves.  But when CN is an even multiple of , then gives the direction of maxima due to interference of the secondary waves.  The angular separation between any two consecutive minima or maxima is given by      Diffraction maxima and minima: Consider the secondary waves traveling in direction with the initial direction of the incident light from a same slit. If the path difference BM is equal to , then will give the direction of diffraction minimum. If the wavefront AB divides into two halves, then the path difference between the corresponding points of the upper and lower half is equal to Hence the point P has no effect due to wavefront coming from slit AB. Similarly, there is no effect at P due to the waves coming from slit CD with the same inclination. In general,        Intensity of Diffraction Pattern due to Double Slits  The intensity due to Fraunhoffer double slits diffraction can be obtained by using eqn. .           Let and we have - The intensity at point P is therefore given by The intensity at central maximum is when and .  In , the red envelop represents the intensity distribution due to diffraction in double slits also called diffraction factor and blue curve represents the intensity distribution due to interference of waves from both the slits also called interference factor.  Interference maxima occur when and first diffraction minimum occurs when . The order of interference maximum coincide with the first order diffraction minimum, which is given by . If . In this case, the first order spectrum will be absent and the resultant diffraction pattern is similar to single slit diffraction. If , then second order spectrum will be absent.   "

  "title": "Diffraction Grating",
  "body": " Diffraction Grating   Diffraction grating is a collection of large number of narrow slits on a plane surface (or spherical surface). The most common type of diffraction gratings are plane gratings and concave gratings. When the incident wavefront on a grating surface is transmitted through the slits and obstructed by the opaque portions it is called a transmission grating. If a fine lines are drawn on a plane glass plate using diamond, then the space between the lines is transparent to light and lines are opaque to light. Such surface acts as a transmission grating.      If the lines are drawn on a silvered glass surface then light is reflected from the surface between two lines and such surface acts as a reflecting grating. The separation between the slits are comparable to the wavelength of light under study. The separation between two adjacent slits is known as granting element. If N is number of lines drawn on a length L then the grating element can be given as Consider secondary waves of angle of deviation with the incident light. The path difference between the waves coming from points A and C of two adjacent slits. For the point P will be of maximum intensity where are order of principal maxima. If the incident light consists of more than one wavelength, then the angles of deviation for different wavelengths will be different.    Grating Spectrometer  A spectrometer is a device used to study the spectrum of light. A grating is a heart of spectrometer as it disperses light of different wavelengths into narrow fringes. The angles of deviation of maxima of these fringes are then used to measure the wavelength precisely. The spectrometer consists of a collimator tube with an adjustable entrance slit, a rotating table on which the diffraction grating can be mounted, a telescope for observing the diffracted light, and an accurate angular scale for measuring the relative directions of the various spectrometer components. The diffraction grating disperses the light, so that the relationship between the diffraction angle and the wavelength of the light is given by the equation     Resolving Power  The capacity of an optical instrument to produce separate images of very closely placed two objects is called resolving power. The resolving power of a grating is defined as the ratio of the wavelength of any spectral line to the difference in wavelength between this line and a neighboring line such that the two lines appear to be just resolved. Thus the resolving power of a grating,                The direction of order primary maximum for wavelength is given by The direction of order primary maximum for wavelength is given by The two lines will be just resolved if the angle of diffraction corresponds to the direction of first secondary minimum after the primary maximum at . The term is the path difference of extreme points of first slit if there are N number of lines (slits) on the grating surface. Wavelength is the path difference between secondary waves from the first point of first slit and the last point of the last slit. Equating eqns. and , we get -     "

  "title": "Polarization",
  "body": " Polarization  Light is an electromagnetic wave of transverse in nature. Interference and diffraction phenomena proved that the light is a wave but could not explain whether it is a transverse or a longitudinal. The polarization of wave helps explain that the light is transverse in nature. When light wave propagates along x-axis, the electric field and magnetic field oscillate along all possible directions which are perpendicular to the x-axis, . Since magnetic field is always perpendicular to the electric field, and is much smaller than it ( ) we usually take the electric field to characterize the property of polarization of light.               If light wave is propagating along x-axis, then electric field oscillates in the xy plane and magnetic field oscillates in the xz plane. Normally, any light source emits unpolarized light, i.e. electric field could vibrates along all possible directions perpendicular to the light propagation. Hence, polarization is a phenomenon of restricting the vibration of electric filed in a single plane. Light is said to be linearly polarized if the direction of oscillation of electric field is confined to one direction. Polarization direction is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation and electric field vector oscillates in a plane of polarization.   Polarization of transverse waves: Let a rope AB be passed through two parallel slits and and point B is fixed. If the rope is disturbed at point A in such a way that it moves up and down then a transverse wave emerges through opening C and D and reaches to point B, . However, if the slit is made perpendicular to slit then it is observed that no vibration can pass through , . This experiment proves that the parallel slits only allow the transverse waves to pass through them. On the other hand, if longitudinal waves are set up by compressing and stretching a spring in place of a rope then it can be seen that waves will pass through both the slits irrespective of their orientations.               A similar phenomenon has been observed in light when it passes through a tourmaline crystal A tourmaline crystal has a hexagonal system with four axes. Three are equal in length and intersect at . The vertical C- axis or longer axis intersects the other shorter axes at The c-axis also called optic axis is associated with unique optical properties. when a beam of plane-polarized light is incident normally on a plate of tourmaline cut parallel to the optic axis, it will be absorbed or transmitted depending upon whether the axis of the tourmaline is parallel or perpendicular to the plane of polarization of the incident light. which acts as a slit and called a Polaroid. A polaroid transmits only the component of light along a particular direction and absorbs the component perpendicular to that direction.               If the ordinary light is passed through these crystals when they are rotating in such a way that their axes are always parallel then no change has been observed in the light coming out of crystal B, . On the other hand, if crystal A is fixed and crystal B is rotated with respect to A then light transmitted through B becomes dimmer gradually and no light is emerges out of B when it is perpendicular to A, . If B is further rotated then light intensity increases gradually and becomes maximum when B becomes parallel to A again. This experiment concludes that light is not propagated as longitudinal waves rather it is transverse in nature otherwise it could never be extinguished by simply rotating crystal B.      Ordinary light waves after passing through crystal A become polarized as their all vibrations filter except the one which is parallel to the crystal (optic) axis. Hence crystal A is also called polarizer and crystal B is called analyzer. The plane of polarization consists no vibrations. The plane in which vibrations are confined after passing through the polarizer is called the plane of vibration, . Ordinary light may consist of large number of wavelengths and vibrations may be linear, circular, or elliptical. Circular or elliptical vibrations consist of two linear vibrations which are perpendicular to each other. The vibrations parallel to plane of the paper are shown as arrow heads and that perpendicular to the plane of paper are shown as dots in .  "
