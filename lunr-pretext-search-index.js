  "body": " General physics is a calculus-based introductory physics book. This book is a concise form of my lecture notes that I have been delivering in my introductory level courses for many years. This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the instructor but is designed to support calculus-based physics materials at a rapid and an efficient way in my personal teaching activities. Students who want to use this text assume to have prerequisite knowledge of some basic mathematical skills such as geometry, algebra, trigonometry, and some advanced mathematical tools such as a differential and integral calculus.  Learning skills by memorization cannot seem to be working efficiently in learning physics. Physics is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different approach than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into two volumes that covers the syllabus of introductory physics at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. General Physics I contains Basics of Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics.  General Physics II contains Electricity, Magnetism, Waves, Acoustics, and Optics. These topics have been carefully chosen to provide an introduction to the basic concepts in physics and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to learn how to investigate and approach problems in a logical manner. This book strives to guide readers to learn physics in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition.  To tackle the physical problems the book uses the 'GUESS' policy for a systematic gatheing of information and finding realistic and logistic solution. Here is what GUESS stands for   G: Given, identify the given information and sketch the information if possible.   U: Unknown, identify the unknown that we are looking for.   E: Equation\/s, set up the equation from given information.   S: Substitute, substitute the number\/s in the equation\/s.   S: Solve, solve the equation to obtain the answer.  Comments and suggestions for improvements to the text will be gratefully accepted -- Author   "

  "title": "Methods of Transferring Charges:",
  "body": " Methods of Transferring Charges:   Charge can neither be created nor be destroyed but it can be transferred from one object to another by the following processes.   Charging by Friction: In this method two neutral objects are rubbed together against each other to transfer charges from one object to another. The object which gains electrons becomes negatively charged and the one which looses electrons becomes positively charged.   Charging by Conduction: In this method charged object are brought in contact to the other object to transfer charges. Uncharged object becomes charged after touching by the charged object. When oppositely charged object brought in contact with each other they lose their charges.   Charging by Induction: In this method an uncharged object is brought near a charged object (no physical contact) to induce a positive and negative charge on it. When charged object is in proximity of uncharged object it produces an electrical force on electrons to move them from one part of object to another. When an insulator is brought near a charged object electrons of insulator atoms experience electrical force which stretches atoms to displace center of gravity of positive charges and negative charges. This phenomenon of separation of charges is called polarization . Hence in induction positive charges are separated from negative charges to produce charges on an object.      Electrophorus:                   It is a device used to produce charges using electrostatic induction. It consists of an insulating base plate and a conducting disc (also known as electrophorus disc) with an insulated handle [ ]. At first insulating plate is rubbed with silk, fur, or wool which produces charges on the plate depending on the type of materials being rubbed together. In the figure above negative charges are produced on the base plate. Electrophorus disk is then brought in contact with this plate and then grounded. Grounding help free charges on disk to neutralize with the opposite charges from the earth (ground). Earth is an infinite source of charges and because electrons are lighter than the positive charges electrons can easily come from earth to the disk to neutralize free positive charges or they can leave the disc to the ground if they are free charges. After grounding, the disk contains only one kind of charges, it is then disconnected from ground before get removed from the plate. All the charges on the disk then spread around its surface which can be stored and used as needed. In this case positive charges are stored from the disk.    Electroscope:      It is an instrument used to detect charge on a body. It consists of two gold (or silver or aluminum) leaves suspended from a conducting rod that leads to the outside of an insulating glass container ( ). The rod has metallic ball attached at its top, when a charged object is brought near the conducting ball or make in contact with it causes the leaves to diverge because like charges repel each other. The nature of charge (positive or negative) on any object can also be determined with the help of electroscope, by making its leaves charged with the known charges.   "

The direction of force is always acting along the line joining these two point charges. If is a force acting on charge due to charge  is a force acting on charge due to charge and is a distance between the two charges ( ) then from Coulumb's law where is unit vector along line joining the two charges, Coulomb's constant of free space, ; and permittivity of free space, Permittivity is an ability of a medium to store electrical energy in an electric field. In other words, permittivity is the extent to which a medium permits electrical lines of force between the charges. It is a resistance of a medium in forming electric fields. It describes the effect of a material in an electrical field. The higher the permittivity, the more the material tends to reduce electrical field (due to polarization) that set up it.                 Coulumb's Law in One Dimension  Coulomb's law holds good only for two point charges but if more than two charges are located in space then the force on each of them can be determined by using the principle of superposition.    Coulomb's Law in Two and Three Dimensions  Use principle of superposition to obtain force on any charge if the charges are distributed at different points in space.   "

  "body": " Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution   Coulomb's law only work for two point charges, if we are dealing with more than two discrete charges then we have to use principle of superposition to find the field at a point using Coulomb's law. Most often charges are distributed on the material in such a rigourous way that applying Coulomb's low is very difficult, e.g. charges are distributed on a sphere, a plane surface, a rod or on some weird surface like pyramid. In that case it would be easier to find an electric field at point by breaking the charge distribution in small elements and treat them like a point charge. Write the equation of electric field for one single element of the charge and integrate them for the entire charge. In order to break these charge distribution in small elements we need to discuss charge density.   Charge Density: Depend upon the surface where charges are distributed uniformly we can have three different types of charge density.   Linear charge density, : If the charges are distributed uniformly in a linear shape then the charge density is called a linear charge density. It is defined as the amount of charge per unit length. Let say the charge Q be distributed smoothly on a wire of length L, then It's unit is Now if a small length contains a charge then    Surface charge density, If the charges are distributed uniformly on a surface area then the charge density is called a surface charge density. It is defined as the amount of charge per unit area. Let say the charge Q be distributed smoothly on a plane of area A, then It's unit is Now if a small area of that surface contains a charge then    Volume charge density, If the charges are distributed uniformly in a volume of any material then the charge density is called a volume charge density.

Hence Coulomb's law can not be applied to determined field at a point for a finite charged conductor.               Consider a symmterical cylindrical Gaussian surface around the charge on an infinitly charged wire of linear charge density is as shown in . Now electric flux, through the surfaces and is given by   From Gauss's law  is the charge enclosed in the Gaussian surface. Hence,  ie., Electric field is inversely proportional to distance of the point from a charged rod [ ].    Electric field due to a uniform infinite cylindrical charge  Consider an infinitely long cylinder of radius R on which electric charge is distributed uniformly. If is charge per unit length and is a volume charge density then          Electric field at any point [ ] outside the cylindrical charge distribution i.e., : Consider a Gaussian surface of radius and length symmetric to the charge distribution. Due to symmetry the field is everywhere normal to the curved surface and has the same magnitude at all points of it. There is no contribution in fluxes due to flat bases of the Gaussian surface as is parallel to them. Hence    Thus the electric field at outside of a uniform infinite cylindrical charge distribution is same as that due to infinite line charge.  Electric field at the point [ ] on the surface of cylindrical charge distribution i.e.,     Electric field at the point [ ] inside the cylindrical charge distribution i.e.,   Thus the electric field inside the cylindrical charge distribution is proportional to the distance of the point from the axis and is directed radially away from the axis. The variation of field with distance from the axis of a cylindrical charge is shown in .      Electric field due to infinite sheet of charge      Consider a symmetrical cylindrical Gaussian surface around the charge on an infinitely charged sheet of surface charge density is as shown in . Now electric flux, through the surfaces and is given by    But from Gauss's law,   Now because of surface symmetry around the charge  That is, field is independent upon the distance of the point as long as the point is not significantly far away. Electric field is normal to the charged sheet except at the edges where it is emitting radially out ward in all possible directions. Hence, Gaussian law can not be applied to determined field at a point for a finite charged conductor.    Electric field just outside a charged conductor  Consider a conductor of any shape AB has given a charge q. This charge will redistribute under electrostatic equilibrium on a conductor in such a way that the field inside the conductor is zero i.e., Now consider a point P just outside of the conductor and be the surface charge density of the conductor.      Now consider a small cylindrical Gaussian surface CD having the base C passing through P, the other side D lying inside the conductor and the curved surface being perpendicular to the surface of the conductor. The flux through the curved surface is zero since there is no component of electric field normal to the curved surface. Also the flux through the base D is zero as electric field inside the conductor is zero. Therefore the resultant flux of the entire surface of the Gaussian cylinder is the same as the flux through the face C which is equal to     Thus the electric field at any point close to the surface of a charged conductor of any shape is equal to times the surface charge density . If is positive, electric field is directed away from the conductor and if it is negative, then field is directed towards the conductor. Obviously field near a plane conductor is twice of the field in front of a non-conducting thin sheet of charge.   "

Prove that any excess charge on a solid conductor must reside on the outside surface of the conductor.  Prove that if a hollow conductor surrounds a charge q, an equal but opposite charge -q resides on the inside surface of the conductor and all excess charge on the outside surface.        In the electrostatic case, charges do not move. Therefore, the charge carriers inside a conductor cannot experience an electrical force. Therefore, the electric field must be zero.    Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, the flux through a Gaussian surface inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the total charge inside the Gaussian surface must be zero. If the Gaussian surface is constructed immediately below the surface of the conductor, the charge inside the surface must still be zero. Since the charge on a conductor cannot reside inside the surface of the conductor, it must reside on the surface.    Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, the flux through a Gaussian surface inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the total charge inside the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore the combined charge inside the hole and on the inner surface of the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the inner surface of the conductor must contain a charge equal and opposite to the charge surrounded by the conductor.

If the electric field at the surface of a conductor has a component parallel to the surface, the charges on the surface will move in that direction. Since they do not move in the electrostatic situation, the electric field must be everywhere perpendicular to the surface of the conductor.    Pick a Gaussian surface surrounding a small enough region of the conductor's surface so the charge density is constant. Let be the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface and the area of the surface of the conductor enclosed by the Gaussian surface. Then the charge per unit area of the conductor in that region of space is     Because is constant in this small region of space, due to symmetry the electric field must be perpendicular to the surface of the conductor and constant at a distance d from the surface.

  "body": " Electric Potential    Electrical Work: When an electric force displaces a charged particle an electrical work is said to done. Since charge experience electric force only in an electric field such work is stored on a charged particle as an electric potential energy at that point. In other words, electrical work is an electrical potential energy, i.e., here, stands for electrostatic force. Here is an applied force, which moves the charged particle in an electric field without acceleration. Unit of electrical work is Joule,J = Nm (Newton.meter).   Electric Potential Energy: The energy stored on a charged particle due its position in an electric field of other charge or charges. It is denoted by . (i.e., Potential energy of b with respect to a). (for Uniform Electric Field).  Electrical force is a conservative force and when conservative force does negative work, the system gains potential energy. When conservative force does positive work, the system loses potential energy. Therefore if charge moves along the direction of electric field. Unit of electric potential energy is Joule.   Electric Potential: It is a work done on a unit positive charge to bring it from infinity to any point in an electrical field of other charge\/s. In other words, electric potential is an electric potential energy of a unit positive charge at a point in any field, i.e., electric potential energy per unit charge is known as electric potential at a point in any field.  Let is any charge and its electric potential energy at that point in a field is then electric potential at that point is    (for a point charge).  Where point is taken at and point is at any point in the electric field. Unit of electric potential is Volt (V) = Joule\/Coulomb (J\/C). Remember that we can only define the potential at a point if the force is conservative. Conservative Force: It is a force which is directed along a certain fixed point. Workdone by these force around a closed path is always zero. Gravitational force, electric force, elastic spring force, are some examples of conservative forces. Non-conservative force: It is a force which change its direction depends upon the object motion. Workdone by these force around a closed path is always non-zero. Frictional force, viscous force, air drag force or any kind of resistive forces are non-conservative forces.    Potential Difference: It is a work done on a unit positive charge to bring it from one point to another point in a field, e.g., if a unit positive charge is brought from a point of electric potential to another point of potential then potential difference between the points is (Potential of b with respect to a). (Two Point Charges).  -ve sign indicates that charge is brought against an electric field, i.e., direction of force is opposite to the displacement. The work is a negative change in potential energy. If work done by a force is positive then potential energy is decreasing and vice a versa. Unit of potential difference is Volt .   Gradient:  gradient It is a change in scalar field Fields: A field is a region of space whose every point defines some kind of physical quantities. Depending upon the nature of physical quantity there are two types of field, scalar field and vector field. A force field defines a force vector at every location in space. A magnetic field defines a magnetic field vector at every location in space. A potential energy field defines a potential energy at every location in space. The gravitational field is a vector field which expresses the value of gravitational force, and Higg's field is a scalar field which defines the mass or energy of a particle. If is a scalar function associated with every point (x,y,z) of any region in space, then the region is defined as a scalar field. Again, if is a vector associated with every point (x,y,z) of any region in space, then the region is defined as a vector field. with respect to space and is a vector quantity whose direction is acting along the greatest change in that field. The gradient of a scalar field is defined as  where an operator is known as operator and read as a gradient or a grad, which is a vector quantity.   Potential Gradient:    Unit of potential gradient is V\/m or N\/C.   Equipotential Surfaces: The portion of an electric field upon which the electrical potential has a fixed value is called a equipotential surfaces. Thus, between any two points on the equipotential surface, i.e., no work is required to move any charge on an equipotential surface. For a positive point charge equipotential surfaces are concentric spherical surfaces around charge at center as shown in . Equipotential surfaces for a positive and negative charges are shown in , and that for two similar charges are shown in .                    Relationship between equipotential surface and electric field:   Electric field is perpendicular to equipotential lines (surfaces) and pointed along the decresing potential.  Electric filed is stronger where equipotential lines (surfaces) are closer to each other.     Corona Discharge:  corona discharge It is an electrical discharge appearing on and around the surface of a conductor by ionization of the surrounding fluid molecules. when a conductor of very large curvature is exposed in a very high electric field corona discharge occurs. The phenomenon of corona discharge can be understood by the following concept.      Consider two conducting spherical sells of radius and containing charges and . The potential on the surface of these sells are and respectively. Suppose they are so designed that they have same potential on the surface, i.e.,      or, surface charge density is inversely proportional to radius of curvature. Hence, as the radius of curvature of a conductor decreases (or, its curvature increases) surface charge density increases. The surface charge density increases enormously at the pointed end of the conductor because of high curvature [ ]. Pointed end produces such a high field that the nearby air molecules stretch as the displacement of center of gravity of their negative and positive charges. Since opposite charge attracts each other the charges on the conductors start neutralizing with the opposite charge of air molecules by producing bluish light surrounding the conductor without a spark such phenomenon is called a corona discharge. In this case no electrical breakdown occurs in air molecules.   Van de Graff generator:       It is a device designed by Van de Graaff in 1929 to generate very high potential differences. It consists of two combs, a conveyor rubber belt (which is mounted on two motorized rollers), and a large conducting dome. Charges are spread on belt with the help of charged comb as comb discharges its charge on air molecules which later stick onto the belt and carried over near the upper comb which then neutralizes these charges on air molecule because of electrostatic induction. Hence the similar kind of charges are getting collected on a big spherical dome connected with the upper comb ( ).   "
