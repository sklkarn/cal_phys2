<div class="para">Spherical mirror is a part of spherical surface which is polished in such a way that one of its side becomes reflecting surface.  If the exterior of a curvature of hollow sphere is coated in such a way that the interior (or cave part) of the surface behaves as reflecting surface then it is called a <dfn class="terminology">concave mirror</dfn>. If the interior of the sphere is coated in such a way that the  exterior (or vex part) behaves as a reflecting surface then it is called a <dfn class="terminology">convex mirror</dfn> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sp_mirror.html" title="Figure 5.2.6">FigureÂ 5.2.6</a>.</div>
