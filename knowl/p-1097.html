<div class="para">A standard candle is made out of sperm wax weighing 1/6 pound, 7/8 inch in diameter, 4.5 cm in height, and it burns at the rate of 120 grains per hour. It was taken as a standard unit of illuminating power of a source in early days. If the source gives off light 60 times as the light given out by a standard candle then its power is taken as 60 candle power. However, such measurement cannot be used in scientific work as the power of candle depends on the shape of wick, size of flame during different seasons.  With the advancement in science standard of light has been defined in terms of blackbody radiation. International unit of Luminous intensity (or, Illuminating power) of source is taken as candela. One candela is 1/60 of the light luminosity coming out of a hole of area <span class="process-math">\(1 \,cm^{2}\)</span> of a hollow cavity acting as a black body radiator maintained at the freezing point (<span class="process-math">\(1773\,^{o}C\)</span>) of platinum.</div>
