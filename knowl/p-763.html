<div class="para">Echo and reverberation are two distinct phenomenon of sound waves which occur due to its reflection from any surfaces. Sound endures in our brain (or we have the memory that sound being in existence for) longer than 0.1 second. If  sound is reflected from any surface reaches to our ear within 0.1 seconds of the initial sound, then it seems that the sound is prolonged. The reception of reflected sound within 0.1 second causes the reverberation - the prolonging of a sound. The speed of sound in air is about 340 m/s at ambient temperature. If the wall of a room is 17 meter away from the source of sound then it reflects back from the wall and reaches to the ear within 0.1 s.</div>
