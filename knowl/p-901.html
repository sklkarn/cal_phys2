<div class="para">Suppose an object O is lying at a depth t below an optically denser medium such as water. A ray of light OC is incident on interface normally and passes along CD without any deviation. Another ray of light OA incident at an <span class="process-math">\(\angle i\)</span> on the interface and refracted along AE at an <span class="process-math">\(\angle r\text{.}\)</span> For a small aperture of eye points A and C are very close to each other and once the rays AE and CD reach to the eye then object appears at point I which is a virtual image of object O. Here in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/refr2.html" title="Figure 5.2.21">Figure 5.2.21</a>, the rays AE and BF are constituting the virtual image $I$ of the object O. Actually in geometrical optics, to see an image of any object at least two rays emanating from the object after reflection or refraction must reach to the oberserver’s eye.</div>
