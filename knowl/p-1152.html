<div class="para">For sustained interference the superposing waves must be in constant phase difference which can be achieved through the following two methods called wavefront division or amplitude division. In wavefront division very narrow slits are taken help to divide the wavefront and form two virtual sources. According to Huygens principle every points on a wavefront behave as secondary sources that are vibrating in phase. Therefore portions of wave front cut by holes (or slits) are coherent sources and waves emitted by them are also coherent as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/coherent1.html" title="Figure 5.8.2.(a)">FigureÂ 5.8.2.(a)</a>.</div>
