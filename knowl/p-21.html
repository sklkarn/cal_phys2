<div class="para">A redistribution of charges in a neutral object when a charged object is brought near it is called an electrostatic induction. Neighboring charges which are brought near a neutral object are known as <em class="emphasis">inducing charges</em>, charges developed on a neutral object are known as <em class="emphasis">induced charges</em>. Induced charges closer to the inducing charges are known as <em class="emphasis">bound charges</em> and charges away from inducing charges are known as <em class="emphasis">free charges</em> (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig2.html" title="Figure 1.1.1">FigureÂ 1.1.1</a>).</div>
