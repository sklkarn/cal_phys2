<div class="para"> A motion of a particle in which it repeats its position after a fixed interval of time is known as <em class="emphasis">periodic motion</em>. A periodic motion in which a restoring force acting on a particle is proportional to its displacement is known as <em class="emphasis">simple harmonic motion</em> (SHM). A planet orbits around the sun, bouncing ball, vibrating tuning fork, oscillation of pendulum are all periodic motion but only vibrating tuning fork, oscillation of pendulum, to and fro motion of spring-mass system are simple harmonic motion. The motion of planet around the sun, motion of a bouncing ball are periodic but not simple harmonic as their motion is not repetitive towards or from the mean position.</div>
