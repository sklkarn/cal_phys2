<div class="para">Because of the tendency to oppose, eddy currents cause energy to be lost. Due to eddy currents kinetic energy transforms into heat energy. One of the practical applications of eddy currents is <dfn class="terminology">magnetic braking</dfn>. During braking, the metal wheels are exposed to a magnetic field from an electromagnet, generating eddy currents in the wheels. The magnetic interaction between the applied field and the eddy currents acts to slow the wheels down. The faster the wheels are spinning, the stronger the effect, meaning that as the train slows the braking force is reduced, producing a smooth stopping motion.</div>
