<div class="para">Astronomical telescope is used to see celestial objects. It consists of two convex lenses one which faces the object is called objective and another is near the eye called eyepiece. Objective has large aperture (to collect sufficient amount of light to produce clear image) and has large focal length. The eyepice has small aperture (to match the size of eye) and short focal length.</div>
