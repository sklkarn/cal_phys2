<div class="para">It is a device used to produce charges using electrostatic induction. It consists of an insulating base plate and a conducting disc (also known as electrophorus disc) with an insulated handle [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig3.html" title="Figure 1.1.2">FigureÂ 1.1.2</a>]. At first insulating plate is rubbed with silk, fur, or wool which produces charges on the plate depending on the type of materials being rubbed together. In the figure above negative charges are produced on the base plate. Electrophorus disk is then brought in contact with this plate and then grounded. Grounding help free charges on disk to neutralize with the opposite charges from the earth (ground). Earth is an infinite source of charges and because electrons are lighter than the positive charges electrons can easily come from earth to the disk to neutralize free positive charges or they can leave the disc to the ground if they are free charges. After grounding, the disk contains only one kind of charges, it is then disconnected from ground before get removed from the plate. All the charges on the disk then spread around its surface which can be stored and used as needed. In this case positive charges are stored from the disk.</div>
