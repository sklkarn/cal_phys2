<div class="para">It is an instrument used to detect charge on a body.  It consists of two gold (or silver or aluminum) leaves suspended from a conducting rod that leads to the outside of an insulating glass container (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/electroscope.html" title="Figure 1.1.3">FigureÂ 1.1.3</a>). The rod has metallic ball attached at its top, when a charged object is brought near the conducting ball or make in contact with it causes the leaves to diverge because like charges repel each other. The nature of charge (positive or negative) on any object can also be determined with the help of electroscope, by making its leaves charged with the known charges.</div>
