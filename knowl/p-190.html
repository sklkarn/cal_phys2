<div class="para">It is a device designed by Van de Graaff in 1929 to generate very high potential differences. It consists of two combs, a conveyor rubber belt (which is mounted on two motorized rollers), and a large conducting dome. Charges are spread on belt with the help of charged comb as comb discharges its charge on air molecules which later stick onto the belt and carried over near the upper comb which then neutralizes these charges on air molecule because of electrostatic induction.  Hence the similar kind of charges are getting collected on a big spherical dome connected with the upper comb (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig1d.html" title="Figure 1.7.3">FigureÂ 1.7.3</a>).</div>
