<div class="para">Round 0.07284 to four, three, and two significant digits: To round 0.07284 to four significant digits, start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. (The zero between the decimal point and the 7 is not significant, as it serves only to "place" the 7 into the hundreds place.) There are only three more digits, so all of them will be included in answer. Since no digit follows the 4, there is no information about rounding, so just leave the 4 as it is. Hence, 0.07284 is four sig-digs.</div>
