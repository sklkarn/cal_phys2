<div class="para">When a stone is thrown in a quiet pond a number of nice circular rings, called <em class="emphasis">ripples</em> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ripples.html" title="Figure 4.2.1.(a)">FigureÂ 4.2.1.(a)</a>] emerge on the surface of the water which grow gently and move across the pond in a concentric pattern. These growing ripples are called a <dfn class="terminology">wave</dfn> which carries energy from the point of stone thrown to the edge of a pond. Hence a wave can be defined as a disturbance in space that can carry energy from one location to another. A wave creates in a medium when a medium is trying to regain its equilibrium state. When a stone is thrown it transfers its energy to the surface of water due to which water layer stretches downwards till stone dips down that layer of water. When stone leaves the water layer, water layer wants to recover its original position to maintain equilibrium due to surface tension but as it reaches to the original position it keeps raising upward because of inertia and stretches the water surface again till reaches the maximum height. Now due to surface tension this layer of water gets pulled down again and starts sinking down below the equilibrium position due to inertia such procedure is the cause of waves on water.</div>
