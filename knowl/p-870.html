<div class="para">The point on the principle axis through which the reflected rays of all the incident rays prallel to the principle axis must pass or appear to diverge from is called a <dfn class="terminology">focus, F</dfn> and the distance between the pole and the focus is called a <dfn class="terminology">focal length, f</dfn> of the mirror as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/concavemir2.html" title="Figure 5.2.7.(a)">Figure 5.2.7.(a)</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/convexmir2.html" title="Figure 5.2.7.(b)">Figure 5.2.7.(b)</a>. The size of the mirror is called the <dfn class="terminology">aperture</dfn> of the mirror. If the aperture of a mirror is small then reflected rays of any beam parallel to the principle axis either must pass through  or appear to diverge from the focus of the the mirror. In the case of a mirror of large aperture these reflected rays fail to meet at a single focus point, such inability of a mirror to focus all the reflected rays of a parallel incident beam at a single point is called geometrical or <em class="emphasis">spherical aberration</em> of the mirror. The light rays that lie close to the principal axis are called <em class="emphasis">paraxial rays</em> and they only able to meet at a single focus after reflection from the mirror. The rays that lie far from the principal axis are called <em class="emphasis">marginal rays</em> and after reflection  they cross the principle axis before focus point. Hence, the reflection of large beam of light from the spherical mirror of large aperture creates a curved shape of light called a <dfn class="terminology">caustic curve</dfn> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/caustic.html" title="Figure 5.2.7.(c)">Figure 5.2.7.(c)</a>. The cusp of caustic curves lie at the focus of the mirror. Spherical aberration can be minimized by using a mirror of small aperture which is smaller compared to its radius of curvature. Parabolic mirror will also minimize such spherical aberration.</div>
