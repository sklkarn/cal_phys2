<div class="para">The phenomenon of overlapping of two or more waves at a point in space is called an <dfn class="terminology">interference</dfn>. Suppose two waves of same amplitudes and frequencies superimpose on each other at a point (in same phase) in such a way that the crest of one falls on the crest of the other or the trough of one falls on the trough of the other then the amplitude of the particle is twice the amplitude of either of the waves. At these points, the waves reinforce with each other. If they superimpose in (opposite phase) such a way that the crest of one falls on the trough of the other then the amplitude is zero. At these points, the waves cancel out the displacement of the particle due to each other. It is possible that in some region of space the energy is more than the energy due to individual waves and in some other region, it is less than that due to individual waves. Hence, the phenomenon of redistribution of energy due to superposition of waves is also termed as <em class="emphasis">interference</em>. This redistribution of energy depends upon the frequency, amplitude, and the phases of individual waves. It should be remembered that there is no loss of energy due to interference. Since intensity is proportional to square of amplitude, the intensity at a maximum displacement is four times than the intensity due to one of the waves. The interference with maximum intensity or maximum amplitude is known as <dfn class="terminology">constructive interference</dfn> and those with minimum intensity or minimum amplitude is known as <dfn class="terminology">destructive interference</dfn>. The interference phenomenon was first demonstrated clearly in Youngâ€™s experiment in 1802.</div>
