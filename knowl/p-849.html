<div class="para">Before <span class="process-math">\(17^{th}\)</span> century, velocity of light was thought to be infinite because of the fact that the flash of lightening is seen instantly and the sound is heard after some time. According to Newton a luminous object continuously emits streams of particles, called <dfn class="terminology">corpuscles</dfn>. Corpuscles are tiny, light, and elastic in nature which travel in a straight line  with very high velocities and can pass through interstices of the particles of matter and posses the property of reflection and transmission. The first unsuccessful attempt to find the velocity of light was made by Galileo in 1600. In 1679, Christian Huygens proposed the wave nature of light. In 1873 James Clerk Maxwell predicted the electromagnetic waves  and calculated speed of light in vacuum by using formula</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{o}\mu_{o}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(8.85\times10^{-12}C^{2}/Nm^{2})(4\pi\times10^{-7}N/A^{2})}} \approx 3.00\times10^{8}\,m/s
