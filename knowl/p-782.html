<div class="para">A loud noise that is created by the <em class="emphasis">shock wave</em> is called a sonic boom. When source of sound is traveling faster than the speed of sound then it produces a sonic boom. Any thing moving faster than the speed of sound is called a supersonic speed. An aircraft which is going at subsonic speeds (lower than that of sound), its sound wave is radiated in all directions in such a way that the individual wavefronts are bunched at he front of the aircraft and spread at the back of it because of forward motion of the aircraft as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/subsonic.html" title="Figure 4.6.4.(b)">Figure 4.6.4.(b)</a>. This effect is well known  as Doppler effect which changes the <em class="emphasis">pitch</em> of the aircraft’s sound as it passes us. When the plane is approaching us its sound has a higher pitch than if it is going away from us. If the aircraft is traveling with the same speed as that of sound (called sonic speed) then the aircraft is at the leading edge of wavefronts that it produces as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sonic.html" title="Figure 4.6.4.(c)">Figure 4.6.4.(c)</a>. All the wavefronts are bunched up at the front of the aircraft. This phenomenon is known as a shock wave. If the aircraft is traveling at the supersonic speeds, then a pressure wave is produced in the shape of the cone whose vertex is at the nose of the aircraft, and whose base is behind the plane. The angle opening of the cone depends on the actual speed the plane is traveling at. All of the sound pressure is contained in this cone as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/supersonic.html" title="Figure 4.6.4.(d)">Figure 4.6.4.(d)</a>. Now imagine that this aircraft is in a level flight. Before the aircraft passes you, you can only see it but you can not hear anything. The pressure cone is trailing behind the aircraft. Once your ears intersect the edge of this cone, your will hear a very loud sound - the sonic boom. Therefore you will hear the sonic boom once your ears intersect this cone.</div>
