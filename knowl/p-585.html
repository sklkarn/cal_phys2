<div class="para">is an imaginary quantity. Complex numbers can be represented graphically by imaging their real components as abscissas and their imaginary components as ordinates as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/complex1.html" title="Figure 3.9.2">Figure 3.9.2</a>. In such plot the complex quantity is represented by a vector, whose length indicates the magnitude of the complex quantity, and whose direction indicates the relative proportion of its real and imaginary constituents. The multiplication of complex vector by j is a vector operation producing a <span class="process-math">\(90^{o}\)</span> counterclock wise rotation of the complex vector without changing its magnitude. Thus,</div>
