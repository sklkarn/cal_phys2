<div class="para">The nature of light described by Newton’s corpuscular theory and Huygens wave theory both have some drawbacks. Corpuscular theory explained somehow the phenomenon of reflection and transmission but unable to explain many observed phenomena such as interference, diffraction, and double refraction. Similarly Huygens idea explained about reflection, double refraction, transmission, interference, and diffraction but unable to explain some other phenomena such as polarization and photoelectric effect. After Fresnel suggestion that the light wave is rather transverse in nature than a longitudinal, polarization can be explained satisfactorily. It also predicted that the velocity of light is slower in optically denser medium which was not the case in Newton’s corpuscular theory. When Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect the presence of ether medium in 1887 the concept of ether was abandoned.</div>
