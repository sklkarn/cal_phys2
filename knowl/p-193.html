<dfn class="terminology">Capacitance:</dfn> The capacity of storing charge on a capacitor is termed as capacitance. when an isolated conductor is given a charge it acquires a certain potential. If is found that the potential  V  acquired by the conductor is proportional to the charge  Q  given to it i.e.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
Q \propto V 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\text{or,}\quad  Q = CV; 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\therefore\quad C  = \frac{Q}{V}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Here C is a proportionality constant known as capacitance of that conductor (or capacitor). Hence capacitance is defined as the charge required to raise the potential of the conductor by unity. Its unit is <dfn class="terminology">Farad</dfn>. If one coulomb of charge stored in a capacitor of potential difference across the plates is one volt then its capacitance is one Farad. Farad is a very large number. The entire earth as a spherical capacitor has a capacitance of only 0.0007  Farad.</div>
