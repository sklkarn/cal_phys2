<div class="para">In case of a conductor separation of charges makes total electric field zero inside it because of its sufficient free charges neutralize the external electric field. In case of dielectrics separation of charges inside it reduces the field because of its bonded electrons can only nullify the external field to a limited extent. For a conductor electric field is only out side of the conductor but within it electric field is zero. In charged conductors the excess charges have distributed themselves optimally further away from one another so as to reduce the total amount of repulsive forces. Once a charged conductor has reached the state of electrostatic equilibrium, there is no further motion of charge about the surface (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fieldinsidec.html" title="Figure 1.2.4.(c)">Figure 1.2.4.(c)</a>) and hence no electric field inside the conductor. If hole is made on a charged conductor still there is no field inside the hole or within the conductor (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fieldinsided.html" title="Figure 1.2.4.(d)">Figure 1.2.4.(d)</a>). If a charge Q is placed inside the hole of a charged (or uncharged) conductor it induces opposite charges at the inner surface and similar charges on the outer surface of the conductor but field within the conductor still remains zero (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fieldinsidee.html" title="Figure 1.2.4.(e)">Figure 1.2.4.(e)</a>).</div>
