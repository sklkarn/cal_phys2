<div class="para"> A wave which appears stand still and does not seem to be moving is called a standing wave. It is a pattern of waves rather than wave itself. When two (or more) progressive waves of same frequency travel in a same medium in opposite directions overlap in such a way that the position of medium particles seem stand still at the same point is know as a standing wave. It is a superposition of progressive wave with its own reflection. There is no onward motion of the disturbance as no particle transfers its motion to the next. Since the waves seem stand still the position of medium particles form a pattern of nodes and antinodes. The point in a medium where amplitude of oscillation is zero is called <dfn class="terminology">nodes</dfn>. The point in a medium where oscillations reach to their maximum value is called  <dfn class="terminology">antinodes</dfn>. All points on the string oscillate at the same frequency but with different amplitudes. Standing wave is one of the normal modes of vibrations of stretched string.</div>
