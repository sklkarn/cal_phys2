<div class="para">A vector is represented by an arrow. The arrow shows the direction of a vector and the length of the arrow represents the magnitude of that vector.  It is denoted by a letter with an arrow over it such as <span class="process-math">\(\vec{OP} = \vec{a}\)</span> and its magnitude is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\vec{|a|}\)</span> or simply by <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig2a.html" title="Figure 2.0.1">FigureÂ 2.0.1</a>. A vector of unit magnitude is called a unit vector and is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\hat{a}\text{,}\)</span> a 'cap', where <span class="process-math">\(\hat{a}=\frac{\vec{a}}{\vec{|a|}}\text{.}\)</span> A vector which specifies the position of point P with respect to its origin O is called a position vector, where points O and P are known as the initial point (tail) and the terminal point (head) of the vector <em class="alert">OP</em>, respectively. The vectors with same magnitude but in opposite direction are termed as negative vectors. Vectors having the same direction are called like vectors, whereas those having opposite directions are called  unlike vectors. The vectors parallel to the same line regardless of their magnitudes and directions are called collinear vectors. The vectors whose directions are not parallel to each other are non-collinear vectors. A system of vectors lying in the parallel planes or in the same plane are called  coplanar vectors. The system of vectors which can not lie in the same plane or parallel planes are called  non-coplanar vectors. </div>
