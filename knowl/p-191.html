<dfn class="terminology">Capacitor:</dfn> It is a charge storing device. It can store electrical energy in the form of electrical charge that produces potential difference across its plates. Since we can also store charge on a conductor it can also be considered as capacitor but it can store a very limited amount of charge for a short duration only. A capacity of storing charge on a conductor can be increased by arranging two or more parallel conducting surfaces that are placed close to each other with insulating material/s between them, e.g. air and/or any dielectrics. If these surfaces are plane we call it a parallel plate capacitor, if they are cylindrical it is a cylindrical capacitor, and if they are spherical it is a spherical capacitor.</div>
