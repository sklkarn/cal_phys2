<div class="para">Coulomb’s law only work for two point charges, if we are dealing with more than two discrete charges then we have to use principle of superposition to find the field at a point using Coulomb’s law. Most often charges are distributed on the material in such a rigourous way that applying Coulomb’s low is very difficult, e.g. charges are distributed on a sphere, a plane surface, a rod or on some weird surface like pyramid. In that case it would be easier to find an electric field at point by breaking the charge distribution in small elements and treat them like a point charge. Write the equation of electric field for one single element of the charge  and integrate them for the entire charge. In order to break these charge distribution in small elements we need to discuss charge density.</div>
