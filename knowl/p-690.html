Transverse waves occur when a spring or string is fixed at one end and wiggled up and down by the other end  as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gr21.html" title="Figure 4.2.2.(b)">Figure 4.2.2.(b)</a>. Both the waves can be easily described by a transverse nature as they are periodic in nature as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gr20.html" title="Figure 4.2.2.(c)">Figure 4.2.2.(c)</a>. The <dfn class="terminology">crest</dfn> is the highest point on a wave. The <dfn class="terminology">trough</dfn> is the valley between two waves. It is the lowest point. The <dfn class="terminology">wavelength,</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> is the distance, either between the crests or troughs of two consecutive waves. It is the length of one complete wave. The <dfn class="terminology">amplitude</dfn>, A is the peak value (either positive or negative) of a wave. The distance from the undisturbed level (equilibrium position) to the trough or crest. The <em class="emphasis">compression</em> is the part of the longitudinal wave where the particles crowded together. The <em class="emphasis">rarefaction</em> is the part of the longitudinal wave where the particles spread out. The <em class="emphasis">wavelength</em> is the distance from compression to compression or rarefaction to rarefaction in a pressure (longitudinal) wave. The <dfn class="terminology">frequency</dfn>, <span class="process-math">\(\nu\)</span> is a number of complete waves per second. If T is a time period to generate one complete wave then</div>
