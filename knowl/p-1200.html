<div class="para">A spectrometer is a device used to study the spectrum of light. A grating is a heart of spectrometer as it disperses light of different wavelengths into narrow fringes. The angles of deviation of maxima of these fringes are then used to measure the  wavelength precisely. The spectrometer consists of a collimator tube with an adjustable entrance slit, a rotating table on which the diffraction grating can be mounted, a telescope for observing the diffracted light, and an accurate angular scale for measuring the relative directions of the various spectrometer components.  The diffraction grating disperses the light, so that the relationship between the diffraction angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> and the wavelength <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> of the light is given by the equation</div>

\begin{equation*}
\,dsin\theta = n\lambda,  \quad  n = 0, 1, 2, \cdots.
