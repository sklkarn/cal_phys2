<div class="para">Diffraction grating is a collection of large number of narrow slits on a plane surface (or spherical surface). The most common type of diffraction gratings are plane gratings and concave gratings. When the incident wavefront on a grating surface is transmitted through the slits and obstructed by the opaque portions it is called a transmission grating. If a fine lines are drawn on a plane glass plate using diamond, then the space between the lines is transparent to light and lines are opaque to light. Such surface acts as a transmission grating.</div>
