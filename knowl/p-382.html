<div class="para">Magnetic field lines are an imaginary path along which a unit north pole could move freely if it is alowed to do so. Magnetic lines are always pointed away from north pole and towards a south pole of a magnet as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/barmagfield.html" title="Figure 3.1.1">FigureÂ 3.1.1</a>. The properties of magnetic field lines can be summarized as:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">The direction of magnetic field is tangent to the field line at any point in space. A small compass needle will point in the direction of the field line.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The strength of the field is proportional to the density of the lines. It is exactly proportional to the number of lines per unit area perpendicular to the lines. Hence the field is stronger near the poles and weeker at far points.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Magnetic field lines can never cross each other, i.e., the field has a unique direction at any point in space.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Magnetic field lines are continuous, forming closed loops without beginning or end. They go from the north pole to the south pole to the north pole again.</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">The north and south poles of a magnet can never be separated. It is a distinct difference from electric field lines, which begin on the positive and end on negative charges.</div>
