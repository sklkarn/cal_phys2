<div class="para">Anatomy of lenses are shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lanatomy.html" title="Figure 5.2.33">FigureÂ 5.2.33</a>.  An imaginary line that bisects the symmetrical lens into two halves is known as <em class="emphasis">vertical axis</em>. The center of sphere of which a surface of lens is a part is known as <em class="emphasis">center of curvature</em>. There are two faces in a lens so it has two centers of curvature, <span class="process-math">\(C_{1},\quad C_{2}\text{.}\)</span> An imaginary straight line that is passing through the geometrical centre of a lens and joining the two centres of curvature of its surfaces is known as <em class="emphasis">optical axis</em>  or principle axis. The light ray passing along this axis is perpendicular to the surfaces and will not deviate. All other rays passing through a lens and its optical center are called secondary axes. The geometric center of a lens is called an <em class="emphasis">optical center</em> of lens. The light ray passing through the optical center will never deviate.</div>
