<div class="para">For a conductor electric field is only out side of the conductor but within it electric field is zero as shown in figure at right. In charged conductors the excess charges have distributed themselves optimally further away from one another so as to reduce the total amount of repulsive forces. Once a charged conductor has reached the state of electrostatic equilibrium, there is no further motion of charge about the surface as shown in figure below.</div>
