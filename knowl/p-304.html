<div class="para">If a load, R is applied between the electrodes then accumulated negative charges begin to flow from cathode to anode via load as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PbCell2.html" title="Figure 2.3.2.(b)">Figure 2.3.2.(b)</a>. Due to which other +ve and -ve ions again start migrating towards electrodes to perform chemical reaction. Hence accumulation of charges on the electrodes in a solution and discharging via load are continuous by maintaing the equilibrium condition. The voltage at this time between the electrodes is known as <em class="emphasis">terminal voltage</em> or terminal potential difference as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/grPb.html" title="Figure 2.3.2.(c)">Figure 2.3.2.(c)</a>. The difference <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon -V \)</span> is called the lost voltage. Lost voltage is proportional to the current or disacharging rate of the electrodes. The straight line <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> shows the ideal case of rate of accumulation of charges on the electrodes. The straight line <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> shows the rate of discharging of electrodes or current through the load. If higher load is applied current decreases on the load depicting line <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in the graph. The projection of intersection point between rate of charging and rate of discharging on x axis gives the value of terminal potential difference (voltage). The terminal voltage increases with increasing load thus decreases the lost voltage on the internal resistance. Lost voltage occurs due to drop of voltage on internal resistance. See the equation above <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-emf1.html" title="Equation 2.3.1">(2.3.1)</a>.</div>
