<div class="para">When two or more waves superimpose (overlap) at a point then the resultant displacement of the medium particle is the algebraic sum of the displacement of the particle due to individual waves. This is known as <dfn class="terminology">principle of superposition</dfn>. Let <span class="process-math">\(y_{1}(x,t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_{2}(x,t)\)</span> are the wave functions of two waves, then from priciple of superposition the resulting displacement of a particle at that point is given by the wave function</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
y(x,t) = y_{1}(x,t)+y_{2}(x,t)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Wave function has a linear property (meaning wave function depends only the first power of x and t but not on their higher power) hence the principle of superposition holds good only in a medium which obeys Hookeâ€™s Law. Superposition of two or more waves gives rise to interference. When two similar waves superimpose in the same phase their amplitude re-enforce each other and resultant amplitude is just the double of their individual amplitude such interference is called a <em class="emphasis">constructive interference</em>. For constructive interference the path difference between two superimposing waves is given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\Delta x = n \lambda, \quad n = 0, 1, 2,\cdots
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">When two similar waves superimpose in the opposite phase their amplitude cancels out each other and resultant amplitude is just zero such interference is called a <em class="emphasis">destructive interference</em>. For destructive interference the path difference between two superimposing waves is given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\Delta x = \frac{n}{2} \lambda, \quad n = 1, 3, 5,\cdots
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The path difference of two waves is related to their phase difference by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \theta = 2\pi \left(\frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}\right)
