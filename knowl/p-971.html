<div class="para">A Cassegrain telescope is constructed of two mirrors as shown at right. The larger, primary mirror is concave, has a hole in the middle, and has a radius of curvature <span class="process-math">\(R_{1} = 2 \,m.\)</span> The smaller, secondary mirror is convex and is located a distance d = 75 cm from the primary mirror. Its radius of curvature <span class="process-math">\(R_{2}\)</span> is such that the final image of a distant star is located a distance F = 10 cm past the hole in the primary mirror.
