<div class="para">If the sheets were kept flat instead of being rolled up, we would have a flat-plate capacitor with only one side of each sheet charged (the one nearest the other sheet). But because of the rolling, the results is the same as if many sheets of alternating charge were stacked on top of one another. Therefore, electrical charge resides on both sides of each sheet (except for the outermost sheets which can be neglected). This doubles the effective area of the sheets making the area A of the capacitor twice the area <span class="process-math">\(A_{1}\)</span> of one sheet. Otherwise, the rolled up capacitor is the same as a regular flat-plate capacitor.</div>
