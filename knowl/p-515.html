<div class="para">The phenomenon of the production of induced emf in a circuit itself due to the change in current through it is called self induction and induced emf is called back emf. The delayed response of changing current in a circuit like solenoid is due to a self induction. This is because the changing magnetic flux through the solenoid produces a self-induced emf to initially oppose any changes as prescribed by Lenzâ€™s Law. This effect is known as coefficient of self-induction or <em class="emphasis">self-inductance</em> of the coil. Actually all circuit elements have some self-inductance. However, only coils with many turns of wire, such as in a solenoid, have substantial self-inductance.</div>
