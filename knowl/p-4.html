<div class="para">Learning skills by memorization cannot seem to be working efficiently in learning physics. Physics is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different approach than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into two volumes that covers the syllabus of introductory physics at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. <dfn class="terminology">General Physics I</dfn>  contains <em class="emphasis">Basics of Mechanics,  Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics.</em> <dfn class="terminology">General Physics II</dfn> contains <em class="emphasis">Electricity, Magnetism, Waves, Acoustics, and Optics.</em> These topics have been carefully chosen to provide an introduction to the basic concepts in physics and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to learn how to investigate and approach problems in a logical manner. This book strives to guide readers to  learn physics in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition.</div>
