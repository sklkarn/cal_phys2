<div class="para">It is an inherent property of a charge. An electric field is produced by one charge and is experienced by another one. It is an electric field of a charge which tells another charge how to move in the space if it is free to do so.  Electric field is defined as a <em class="emphasis">force per unit charge</em> and is a vector quantity. It is directed along the direction of force on a unit positive charge, i.e., electric field of a point charge</div>
