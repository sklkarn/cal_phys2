<div class="para">Geomagnetism is the study of the dynamics of the Earth’s magnetic field, which is produced in the inner core. The Earth’s magnetic field is predominantly a geo-axial dipole, with north and south magnetic poles located near the <span class="process-math">\(10^{o}\)</span> from the geographic poles that undergo periodic reversals and excursions. The Earth’s magnetic field is attributed to a dynamo effect of circulating electric current, but it is not constant in direction. Rock specimens of different ages in similar locations have different directions of permanent magnetization. The circulating electric currents in the Earth’s molten metallic core are the cause of the earth’s magnetic field. Convection drives the outer-core fluid and it circulates relative to the earth. This means the electrically conducting material moves relative to the earth’s magnetic field. If it can obtain a charge by some interaction like friction between layers, an effective current loop could be produced. The magnetic field of a current loop could sustain the magnetic dipole type field of the earth [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/earthmagfield.html" title="Figure 3.1.5.(a)">Figure 3.1.5.(a)</a>]. The  magnitude of magnetic field at the surface of the Earth is about <em class="emphasis">half a Gauss</em> and dips toward the Earth in the northern hemisphere. The magnitude varies over the surface of the Earth in the range 0.3  to 0.6 Gauss.</div>
