<div class="para">A tool used to produce a musical sound is known as musical instrument, e.g., guitar, violin, flute, vocal cord, etc. The property of sound can be defined by its pitch, loudness, periodicity, and quality. Some terminologies of physics used to describe the property of sound in musical instruments are being discussed here. The property of an oscillating system in which system prefers to vibrate in certain special ways are called <dfn class="terminology">normal modes</dfn> or natural frequency. It is a pattern of vibrational motion in which all parts of the system oscillates sinusoidally with the same frequency with constant phase relation between different parts of the system. Any possible vibrational pattern of a system can be decomposed into a linear combination of these normal modes.  The simplest normal mode of vibration in which system can oscillate is known as <dfn class="terminology">fundamental mode</dfn> or fundamental frequency. It is the lowest frequency produced by an instrument.</div>
