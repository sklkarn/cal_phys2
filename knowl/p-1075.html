<div class="para">so we can increase the magnification by reducing the focal length of the lens but there is a limitation to decrease the focal length. Short focal length needs large curvature of the surface and hence the small field of view. Therefore, two separate convex lenses are used to increase the magnifying power. The lens near the eye is called an <dfn class="terminology">eyepiece</dfn> and has high focal length and large aperture. The lens near the object is called an <dfn class="terminology">objective</dfn> and has low focal length and small aperture. The aperture of eyepiece is larger because of the size of eye is larger than the size of object.</div>
