<div class="para">The phenomenon of producing a maximum loudness periodically when two sound waves of same amplitude and slightly different frequencies are superimposed is known as  <dfn class="terminology">beats</dfn>. The frequency of the beats depends upon the difference in frequency of the two waves. If the frequency difference is larger than 20 Hz, a tone is usually perceived separately rather than distinct beats. Beat frequency is given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f_{beat} = \Delta f = |f_{a} -f_{b}| 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(f_{a}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_{b} \)</span> are frequencies of the two waves. When two such waves superimpose there is a variation in amplitude of resulting wave which causes the change in loudness and hence the beats are produced.</div>
