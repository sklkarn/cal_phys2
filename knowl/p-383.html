<dfn class="terminology">Magnetic Dipole:</dfn> When two equal but opposite magnetic poles are separated by a small distance it is called a magnetic dipole. Since magnetic monopoles do not exist it can better be defined in the form of a current loop. The orbiting or spinning electron forms a current loop which generates a magnetic field called a magnetic dipole and its strength is called a magnetic dipole moment, <span class="process-math">\(\mu= IA,\)</span> where I is a current and A is area of the loop as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/dipolemnt.html" title="Figure 3.1.2.(a)">Figure 3.1.2.(a)</a>. It is a vector quantity which is used to measure the tendency of an object to interact with an external magnetic field. The direction of dipole moment is described by right hand thumb rule. If four fingers of right hand are curled up in a direction of current then thumb pointed in the direction of dipole moment. When there are unpaired electrons in an orbital of an atom their spin moments do not cancel out and give rise to overall magnetic moment of the material. As the single electrons are added the spin moments are combined and the resultant spin moments of the atom increases and become maximum when the outer shell is half filled. Spin moments decreases as further electrons are added to the outer-shell until it is completely filled. The magnetic field around a current loop is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/dipolemntb.html" title="Figure 3.1.2.(b)">Figure 3.1.2.(b)</a>. The direction and magnitude of field (lines) depend upon the position of point of consideration from the center of the current loop. Field is perpendicular to the plane of loop at its center.</div>
