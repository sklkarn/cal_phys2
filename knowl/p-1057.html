<div class="para">In this defect, objects far from eye appear blurred and that near eye appears clear. When objects lie near eye eyelens can contract to become thicker and  achieve shorter focal length to produce image of near objects at retina and hence objects appeared clear. When objects are  far from eye eyelens cannot stretch to become sufficiently thinner and achieve longer focal length to produce image of such objects on retina and hence it forms image in front of retina as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/myopia.html" title="Figure 5.6.5.(a)">Figure 5.6.5.(a)</a>. Actually, when objects lie anywhere between new far point F and near point N, eye can accommodate itself for clear vision but produces image in front of retina to any objects farther than point F. To correct myopic eye a concave lens of suitable focal length can be used as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/myopia2.html" title="Figure 5.6.5.(b)">Figure 5.6.5.(b)</a>.</div>
