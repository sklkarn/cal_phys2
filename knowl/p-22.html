<div class="para">Charge can neither be created nor be destroyed but  it can be transferred from one object to another by the following processes.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Charging by Friction:</dfn> In this method two neutral objects are rubbed together against each other to transfer charges from one object to another. The object which gains electrons becomes negatively charged and the one which looses electrons becomes positively charged.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Charging by Conduction:</dfn> In this method charged object are brought in contact to the other object to transfer charges. Uncharged object becomes charged after touching by the charged object. When oppositely charged object brought in contact with each other they lose their charges.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Charging by Induction:</dfn> In this method an uncharged object is brought near a charged object (no physical contact) to induce a positive and negative charge on it. When charged object is in proximity of uncharged object it produces an electrical force on electrons to move them from one part of object to another. When an insulator is brought near a charged object electrons of insulator atoms experience electrical force which stretches atoms to  displace center of gravity of positive charges and negative charges. This phenomenon of separation of charges is called <em class="emphasis">polarization</em>. Hence in induction positive charges are separated from negative charges to produce charges on an object.</div></li>
