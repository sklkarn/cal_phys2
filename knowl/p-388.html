<div class="para">It has a very strong magnetization. <dfn class="terminology">Magnetization</dfn> is a physical process of being magnetized when a material is subjected to an external magnetic field. The atomic dipole moments are very strong in these type of materials. Most permanent magnets are ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium. Transition metals and some rare earth metals exhibits ferromagnetic behavior. Unpaired electrons spins in partially filled orbitals gives rise to a local magnetic moment. Actually, unpaired electrons containing atoms are very close to each other (and hence there is strong exchange interactions between them) which creates domains in the crystal structure that have the same direction supporting each other. In ferromagnetic materials magnetic dipoles are aligned in a specific direction in a small group within the materials called a <em class="emphasis">domain</em>. The direction of dipole moments vary from one domain to another which cancels the effect of one another and material does not show any intrinsic specific magnetic behavior. But as the material is exposed to an external magnetic field dipole moments of all domains aligned in the direction of external magnetic field and material behaves like a magnet. Once the dipoles aligned in one direction they retain in the same direction even after removal of external field. Hence the permanent magnets are made out of ferromagnetic materials. Bar magnet, horse shoe magnet, disc magnet, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/magnets.html" title="Figure 3.1.4.(a)">Figure 3.1.4.(a)</a>. are some examples of permanent magnets. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/elemag.html" title="Figure 3.1.4.(b)">Figure 3.1.4.(b)</a> is an electromagnet whose core is often made from ferromagnetic material.</div>
