<div class="para">There are two positions in optical instruments where final image has been produced to observe. When the final image is produced at the position where it is expected to see clearly is called <dfn class="terminology">normal adjustment</dfn>. For a simple or compound microscope normal adjustment is the position when final image is formed at the least distance of distinct vision but for telescope normal adjustment is the position of obtaining the final image at infinity. For the object which is at a far distance and very small we want to see its big image and hence telescope is set normally to see the final image at infinity. For the object which is near but extremely small we want to see it very distinctly and highly resolved hence microscope is used to form the final image of objects at our near point of clear vision which is about 25 cm from eye.</div>
