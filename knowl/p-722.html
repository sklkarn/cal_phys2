<dfn class="terminology">Absolute Temperature, T:</dfn> The value of temperature measured in Kelvin scale, a hypothetical temperature scale, is known as absolute temperature. It is also known as thermodynamic temperature. The lowest possible value of absolute temperature is absolute zero and from third law of thermodynamics, absolute zero is physical unattainable by any means. Temperature is an average kinetic energy per molecule of a substance and at absolute zero the molecular motion is ceased i.e. no heat remains in a molecule at absolute zero. The value of each division of kelvin scale is same as that in centigrade scale i.e., change in temperature in absolute scale is numerically equal to change in temperature in centigrade scale. Absolute zero is equal to  <span class="process-math">\(-270.15\,^{o}C.\)</span>
