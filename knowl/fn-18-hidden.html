<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">A tourmaline crystal has a hexagonal system with four axes. Three are equal in length and intersect at <span class="process-math">\(60^{o}\text{.}\)</span> The vertical C- axis or longer axis intersects the other shorter axes at <span class="process-math">\(90^{o}. \)</span> The c-axis also called optic axis is associated with unique optical properties. when a beam of plane-polarized light is incident normally on a plate of tourmaline cut parallel to the optic axis, it will be absorbed or transmitted depending upon whether the axis of the tourmaline is parallel or perpendicular to the plane of polarization of the incident light.</div></body>
