<div class="para">Reflection from a smooth surface such as a mirror leads to a type of reflection known as regular reflection. In regular reflection a parallel incident beam after reflection deviates parallely onto another direction as shown <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ref.html" title="Figure 5.2.3.(a)">Figure 5.2.3.(a)</a>. Reflection from a rough surface such as paper, wall, and clothes leads to a diffuse reflection. In diffuse reflection rays of light in a parallel incident beam after reflection scattered in different directions as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/diffuse.html" title="Figure 5.2.3.(b)">Figure 5.2.3.(b)</a>. Whether it is a regular or a diffuse reflection laws of reflection are always obeyed by each individual light ray of the beam at every point of incidence. The normals at the point of incidences P, Q, and R in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/diffuse.html" title="Figure 5.2.3.(b)">Figure 5.2.3.(b)</a> are shown by the dotted lines. The normal on a rough surface depends on a inclination of local surface at the point of incidence hence these normals are not parallel which constitutes parallel beam of light to be scattered in different directions. The orientation of the normal lines at neighboring points along a surface differentiates specular from diffuse reflection. If the normal lines are parallel, reflection will be specular. If they are not parallel, reflection will be diffuse.</div>
