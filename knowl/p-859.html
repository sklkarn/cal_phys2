<div class="para">A mirror is a highly polished smooth surface which allows a regular reflection. When these reflected rays fall in our eyes we see the image of that object. Depends upon the shape of reflecting surface there are many types of mirror such as plane mirror, spherical mirror, parabolic mirror, etc. There are also two types of existence of image (or object) called a <em class="emphasis">real image or object</em> and a <em class="emphasis">virtual image or object</em>. If incident rays are coming from an object lying in front of the mirror, object is known as real. If incident rays appear to converge behind the mirror, the point of convergence is known as virtual object. If reflected rays actually converge the image formed is real. A real image is always formed in front of the mirror. If reflected rays are divergent that is they do not meet actually, rather they appear to come from a point, that point is called virtual image. A virtual image is always formed behind the mirror. In real image light rays which constitute an image is really passing through it. In virtual image the light rays which constitute that image do not actually pass through it but only appear to do so. Real image can be cast on a screen but virtual image can not be cast on a screen as it is formed behind the reflecting surface. Plane mirror never form a real image of any real object.</div>
