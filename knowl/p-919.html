<div class="para">Consider a ray OP is incident on the refracting face, AB of the prism of refracting angle A. After refraction through the prism the ray emerges along QR and gets deviated by an angle <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> from its original direction. If a prism ABC is rotated about a point P in such a way that angle of incidence increases gradually,then the angle of deviation, <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> start decreasing initially obtains the minimum value and then start increasing again. The condition at which angle of deviation becomes minimum is called the angle of minimum deviation, <span class="process-math">\(\delta_{min}\)</span> and it is a very special case in prism. At <span class="process-math">\(\delta_{min}\)</span> the refracted ray inside the prism is parallel to the base of the prism, and hence angle of incidence, i = angle of emergence, e. This condition is useful to determine the refractive index of the material of the prism.</div>
