<div class="para">As a light wave incident from the air into the soap film, part of it reflects off the top surface. When it does, it reflects inverted because it was moving from less dense air to more dense soap film. Most of the light energy transmitted into the soap film  where a small part of it reflects off again from the bottom surface of the soap film. This time, the wave reflects unchanged because it was going from more dense soap film to less dense air. When this wave energy transmits back into the air, it is <em class="emphasis">out-of-phase</em> with the wave that is reflecting off the top surface. This means that a crest of one matches up with a trough of the other. Interference of waves tells us that they will cancel each other out at this point. The overall effect is that some of the colors in the original white light disappear altogether, leaving other colors behind. These are the colors you see in soap bubbles.</div>
