  "body": " General physics is a calculus-based introductory physics book. This book is a concise form of my lecture notes that I have been delivering in my introductory level courses for many years. This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the instructor but is designed to support calculus-based physics materials at a rapid and an efficient way in my personal teaching activities. Students who want to use this text assume to have prerequisite knowledge of some basic mathematical skills such as geometry, algebra, trigonometry, and some advanced mathematical tools such as a differential and integral calculus.  Learning skills by memorization cannot seem to be working efficiently in learning physics. Physics is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different approach than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into two volumes that covers the syllabus of introductory physics at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. General Physics I contains Basics of Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics.  General Physics II contains Electricity, Magnetism, Waves, Acoustics, and Optics. These topics have been carefully chosen to provide an introduction to the basic concepts in physics and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to learn how to investigate and approach problems in a logical manner. This book strives to guide readers to learn physics in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition.  To tackle the physical problems the book uses the 'GUESS' policy for a systematic gatheing of information and finding realistic and logistic solution. Here is what GUESS stands for   G: Given, identify the given information and sketch the information if possible.   U: Unknown, identify the unknown that we are looking for.   E: Equation\/s, set up the equation from given information.   S: Substitute, substitute the number\/s in the equation\/s.   S: Solve, solve the equation to obtain the answer.  Comments and suggestions for improvements to the text will be gratefully accepted -- Author   "

  "title": "Methods of Transferring Charges:",
  "body": " Methods of Transferring Charges:   Charge can neither be created nor be destroyed but it can be transferred from one object to another by the following processes.   Charging by Friction: In this method two neutral objects are rubbed together against each other to transfer charges from one object to another. The object which gains electrons becomes negatively charged and the one which looses electrons becomes positively charged.   Charging by Conduction: In this method charged object are brought in contact to the other object to transfer charges. Uncharged object becomes charged after touching by the charged object. When oppositely charged object brought in contact with each other they lose their charges.   Charging by Induction: In this method an uncharged object is brought near a charged object (no physical contact) to induce a positive and negative charge on it. When charged object is in proximity of uncharged object it produces an electrical force on electrons to move them from one part of object to another. When an insulator is brought near a charged object electrons of insulator atoms experience electrical force which stretches atoms to displace center of gravity of positive charges and negative charges. This phenomenon of separation of charges is called polarization . Hence in induction positive charges are separated from negative charges to produce charges on an object.      Electrophorus:                   It is a device used to produce charges using electrostatic induction. It consists of an insulating base plate and a conducting disc (also known as electrophorus disc) with an insulated handle [ ]. At first insulating plate is rubbed with silk, fur, or wool which produces charges on the plate depending on the type of materials being rubbed together. In the figure above negative charges are produced on the base plate. Electrophorus disk is then brought in contact with this plate and then grounded. Grounding help free charges on disk to neutralize with the opposite charges from the earth (ground). Earth is an infinite source of charges and because electrons are lighter than the positive charges electrons can easily come from earth to the disk to neutralize free positive charges or they can leave the disc to the ground if they are free charges. After grounding, the disk contains only one kind of charges, it is then disconnected from ground before get removed from the plate. All the charges on the disk then spread around its surface which can be stored and used as needed. In this case positive charges are stored from the disk.    Electroscope:      It is an instrument used to detect charge on a body. It consists of two gold (or silver or aluminum) leaves suspended from a conducting rod that leads to the outside of an insulating glass container ( ). The rod has metallic ball attached at its top, when a charged object is brought near the conducting ball or make in contact with it causes the leaves to diverge because like charges repel each other. The nature of charge (positive or negative) on any object can also be determined with the help of electroscope, by making its leaves charged with the known charges.   "

The direction of force is always acting along the line joining these two point charges. If is a force acting on charge due to charge  is a force acting on charge due to charge and is a distance between the two charges ( ) then from Coulumb's law where is unit vector along line joining the two charges, Coulomb's constant of free space, ; and permittivity of free space,  Permittivity is an ability of a medium to store electrical energy in an electric field. In other words, permittivity is the extent to which a medium permits electrical lines of force between the charges. It is a resistance of a medium in forming electric fields. It describes the effect of a material in an electrical field. The higher the permittivity, the more the material tends to reduce electrical field (due to polarization) that set up it.                 Coulumb's Law in One Dimension  Coulomb's law holds good only for two point charges but if more than two charges are located in space then the force on each of them can be determined by using the principle of superposition.    Coulomb's Law in Two and Three Dimensions  Use principle of superposition to obtain force on any charge if the charges are distributed at different points in space.   "

  "title": "Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution",
  "body": " Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution   Coulomb's law only work for two point charges, if we are dealing with more than two discrete charges then we have to use principle of superposition to find the field at a point using Coulomb's law. Most often charges are distributed on the material in such a rigourous way that applying Coulomb's low is very difficult, e.g. charges are distributed on a sphere, a plane surface, a rod or on some weird surface like pyramid. In that case it would be easier to find an electric field at point by breaking the charge distribution in small elements and treat them like a point charge. Write the equation of electric field for one single element of the charge and integrate them for the entire charge. In order to break these charge distribution in small elements we need to discuss charge density.   Charge Density: Depend upon the surface where charges are distributed uniformly we can have three different types of charge density.   Linear charge density, : If the charges are distributed uniformly in a linear shape then the charge density is called a linear charge density. It is defined as the amount of charge per unit length. Let say the charge Q be distributed smoothly on a wire of length L, then It's unit is Now if a small length contains a charge then    Surface charge density, If the charges are distributed uniformly on a surface area then the charge density is called a surface charge density. It is defined as the amount of charge per unit area. Let say the charge Q be distributed smoothly on a plane of area A, then It's unit is Now if a small area of that surface contains a charge then    Volume charge density, If the charges are distributed uniformly in a volume of any material then the charge density is called a volume charge density.

Hence Coulomb's law can not be applied to determined field at a point for a finite charged conductor.               Consider a symmterical cylindrical Gaussian surface around the charge on an infinitly charged wire of linear charge density is as shown in . Now electric flux, through the surfaces and is given by   From Gauss's law  is the charge enclosed in the Gaussian surface. Hence,  ie., Electric field is inversely proportional to distance of the point from a charged rod [ ].    Electric field due to a uniform infinite cylindrical charge  Consider an infinitely long cylinder of radius R on which electric charge is distributed uniformly. If is charge per unit length and is a volume charge density then          Electric field at any point [ ] outside the cylindrical charge distribution i.e., : Consider a Gaussian surface of radius and length symmetric to the charge distribution. Due to symmetry the field is everywhere normal to the curved surface and has the same magnitude at all points of it. There is no contribution in fluxes due to flat bases of the Gaussian surface as is parallel to them. Hence    Thus the electric field at outside of a uniform infinite cylindrical charge distribution is same as that due to infinite line charge.  Electric field at the point [ ] on the surface of cylindrical charge distribution i.e.,     Electric field at the point [ ] inside the cylindrical charge distribution i.e.,   Thus the electric field inside the cylindrical charge distribution is proportional to the distance of the point from the axis and is directed radially away from the axis. The variation of field with distance from the axis of a cylindrical charge is shown in .      Electric field due to infinite sheet of charge      Consider a symmetrical cylindrical Gaussian surface around the charge on an infinitely charged sheet of surface charge density is as shown in . Now electric flux, through the surfaces and is given by    But from Gauss's law,   Now because of surface symmetry around the charge  That is, field is independent upon the distance of the point as long as the point is not significantly far away. Electric field is normal to the charged sheet except at the edges where it is emitting radially out ward in all possible directions. Hence, Gaussian law can not be applied to determined field at a point for a finite charged conductor.    Electric field just outside a charged conductor  Consider a conductor of any shape AB has given a charge q. This charge will redistribute under electrostatic equilibrium on a conductor in such a way that the field inside the conductor is zero i.e., Now consider a point P just outside of the conductor and be the surface charge density of the conductor.      Now consider a small cylindrical Gaussian surface CD having the base C passing through P, the other side D lying inside the conductor and the curved surface being perpendicular to the surface of the conductor. The flux through the curved surface is zero since there is no component of electric field normal to the curved surface. Also the flux through the base D is zero as electric field inside the conductor is zero. Therefore the resultant flux of the entire surface of the Gaussian cylinder is the same as the flux through the face C which is equal to     Thus the electric field at any point close to the surface of a charged conductor of any shape is equal to times the surface charge density . If is positive, electric field is directed away from the conductor and if it is negative, then field is directed towards the conductor. Obviously field near a plane conductor is twice of the field in front of a non-conducting thin sheet of charge.   "

Prove that any excess charge on a solid conductor must reside on the outside surface of the conductor.  Prove that if a hollow conductor surrounds a charge q, an equal but opposite charge -q resides on the inside surface of the conductor and all excess charge on the outside surface.        In the electrostatic case, charges do not move. Therefore, the charge carriers inside a conductor cannot experience an electrical force. Therefore, the electric field must be zero.    Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, the flux through a Gaussian surface inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the total charge inside the Gaussian surface must be zero. If the Gaussian surface is constructed immediately below the surface of the conductor, the charge inside the surface must still be zero. Since the charge on a conductor cannot reside inside the surface of the conductor, it must reside on the surface.    Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, the flux through a Gaussian surface inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the total charge inside the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore the combined charge inside the hole and on the inner surface of the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the inner surface of the conductor must contain a charge equal and opposite to the charge surrounded by the conductor. Therefore, any remaining charge must reside on the outer surface of the conductor.          A charge q is placed at the center of a cylinder of radius R and length l.

If the electric field at the surface of a conductor has a component parallel to the surface, the charges on the surface will move in that direction. Since they do not move in the electrostatic situation, the electric field must be everywhere perpendicular to the surface of the conductor.    Pick a Gaussian surface surrounding a small enough region of the conductor's surface so the charge density is constant. Let be the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface and the area of the surface of the conductor enclosed by the Gaussian surface. Then the charge per unit area of the conductor in that region of space is     Because is constant in this small region of space, due to symmetry the electric field must be perpendicular to the surface of the conductor and constant at a distance d from the surface.

  "title": "Capacitors",
  "body": " Capacitors       In any electronic circuit we can see some of these types of devices [ ]. They are known as condenser or capacitor .   Capacitor: It is a charge storing device. It can store electrical energy in the form of electrical charge that produces potential difference across its plates. Since we can also store charge on a conductor it can also be considered as capacitor but it can store a very limited amount of charge for a short duration only. A capacity of storing charge on a conductor can be increased by arranging two or more parallel conducting surfaces that are placed close to each other with insulating material\/s between them, e.g. air and\/or any dielectrics. If these surfaces are plane we call it a parallel plate capacitor, if they are cylindrical it is a cylindrical capacitor, and if they are spherical it is a spherical capacitor.                Capacitance: The capacity of storing charge on a capacitor is termed as capacitance. when an isolated conductor is given a charge it acquires a certain potential. If is found that the potential V acquired by the conductor is proportional to the charge Q given to it i.e.   Here C is a proportionality constant known as capacitance of that conductor (or capacitor). Hence capacitance is defined as the charge required to raise the potential of the conductor by unity. Its unit is Farad . If one coulomb of charge stored in a capacitor of potential difference across the plates is one volt then its capacitance is one Farad. Farad is a very large number. The entire earth as a spherical capacitor has a capacitance of only 0.0007 Farad.  The increase of capacitance of a conductor can be understood by the following arrangement. Let A be an isolated conductor which is charged to a maximum potential V volts. [ Note: Potential refers to a potential difference of a conductor with respect to ground.]  Suppose we want to store some more charge on it then we have to reduce its potential somehow before putting any charge. So another isolated conductor B is brought near A then A induces negative charges on the inner surface of B and positive charges on the outer surface as shown in . The negative charge on B tends to reduce the potential of A and positive charge on B tends to increase potential of A. Since negative charges of B are closer to A than the positive charges of B the net potential of A is reduced by some amount. This slight decrees in potential of A results increase of capacitance of A because of relation remaining Q constant. Hence a more charge can be stored on the same conductor till the potential again reaches to V. The capacitance can be considerably high if the conductors are placed very close to each other and a conductor B is grounded ( ). The relation explains that the increase in permitivity of the dielectric medium between conducting plates also increases the capacitance.   Absolute Permittivity, : [ ] It is a permittivity of a medium and defines how difficult it is for a medium to form an electric field.     Combination of Capacitors  The two or more than two capacitors can be grouped in an electrical circuit to achieve certain task. These group may be series or parallel or in combination of both.                      Series Combination of Capacitors When capacitors are connected in such a way that same charge is seemed to be passing through each capacitor then the combination is called a series combination of capacitors. In this case positive terminal of one capacitor is connected to the negative terminal of another capacitor as shown in . If charge Q is sent in the circuit by a battery of emf, V [ ], then  Now replace these capacitors with such a single capacitor that draws a same amount of charge Q from the same battery as shown in , then this new capacitor is called an equivalent capacitor of all these previous capacitors in series. Hence, from eqns. and , we get -    Parallel Combination of Capacitors When capacitors are connected in such a way that charges are distributed among capacitors then the combination is called a parallel combination of capacitors. In this case similar terminals of capacitors are connected together as shown in . If q is the charge sent in the circuit by a battery of emf, V then  Now if these capacitors are replaced by a single capacitor, such that circuit draws the same amount of charge from the same battery ( ), then Hence from eqns. and , we get -       Parallel-Plate Capacitor  A parallel plate capacitor [ ] consists of two metal plates of large surface area placed close to each other parallely with one of the plates grounded. Let be the surface area of the plates and they are separated by a distance apart. If surface charge density of the plates are and space between the plates is filled with dielectric of permittivity Then the electric field between the plates is given by   pointed along -ve plate.  where is the potential difference between the plates and the angle between and is  If the space between the plates is filled with dielectric with permitivity then capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by        Dielectric constant, (or Relative Permitivity, ): It is a measure of insulating ability of a medium. It is a ratio of the permitivity of the medium to the permitivity of a free space i.e., It is an ability of a medium to store electrical energy in presence of electric field.     Spherical Capacitor  A spherical capacitor consists of two concentric conducting spherical shells [ ] of inner radius and outer radius such that and space between them is filled with dielectric of permittivity . If a charge is given to the inner shell then amount of charge is induced on the inner surface of outer shell and charge on the outer surface of outer shell. As the outer surface is grounded charge neutralizes with the negative charge coming from the earth. Now using Gauss's law the electric field at any point between the shells is given        where is the radius of Gaussian surface and is the charge enclosed by it. The potential difference between the shells is then,   Hence the capacitance of the spherical capacitor is given by If , then Which is the capacitance of an isolated spherical conductor of radius .    Cylindrical Capacitor      A cylindrical capacitor consists of two concentric conducting cylindrical shells of inner radius and outer radius [ ] such that and space between them is filled with dielectric of permittivity . If a charge is given to the inner shell then the charge is induced on the inner surface of outer shell and charge on the outer surface of outer shell. As the outer cylinder is grounded charge neutralizes with the negative charge coming from the earth. Now using Gauss's law the electric field at any point between the shells is given by  where is the radius of Gaussian surface and is the surface charge density of the inner cylinder. The potential difference between the shells is then,   Hence the capacitance of the cylindrical capacitor of length is given by    "

Usually , being resistance of the conductor. Hence      Resistivity or Specific Resistance, :  We know that if a conductor of length has a potential difference across its ends is then electric field can be given as [ ] and if current, is flowing in this conductor of area of cross-section , then current density is . Now using Ohm's law, we have In this expression resistance of the conductor of the given length and area of cross-section are all constant. Hence we can write electrical field as where is known as a specific resistance or resistivity of the conductor. It is a property of the material. Different material has a different resistivity. If a conductor of length has a cross-section area then i.e., resistivity of a conductor is a resistance of a unit length of the conductor of unit area cross-section. It's unit is  The reciprocal of resistivty is known as conductivity , Such expression allows us to compare electrical field with current density such as      Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity  The resistivity of a conductor varies with temperature such that where are resistivity at temperature and and are constants whose value depend on material. If temperature is not sufficiently large then higher order terms are neglected hence,  Here the constant is called temperature coefficient of resistivity of a conductor. It defines the material property. Now as resistance is proportional to the resistivity, we can write i.e., a resistance or resistivity of metallic conductors increases with temperature.

  "body": " A summary on internal resistance, emf, and terminal potential difference:                    To understand internal resistance and emf lets consider a lead-acid cell. However, the similar senario could be applied for any other alkaline cells. In lead - acid cell dilute has been used as an electrolyte which gets dissociated in ions and ions in aquous environment as shown in . Now ion migrates towards electrode, captures electron from the electrode and becomes nacent hydrogen atom. Nacent then reacts with and forms and . instantly reacts with molecule and converted into . As charges start accumulating on electrode, we call it a plate of the cell.  On the otherhand, ion attracts towards electrode, dumps its negative charges on it and becomes radical which instantly reacts with to form . In this case electrode starts accumulating charges and becomes a plate of the cell. This process continues till sufficient charges accumulate on these electrodes and it is difficult for the other ions to migrate towards these electrodes because of electrostatic repulsion between the same charges. When transferring of charges by the ions to their respective electrodes stop then electrode has accumated maximum positive charge and electrode has accumulated maximum negative charge. This condition builds up maximum potential difference between the electrodes which is known as electromottife force, emf . The name emf is misleading but it came from its founder, \" Alessandro Volta \" who had used this term as the real reason behind the motion of these charges in the external circuit was not known. The chemical reactions on the electrodes are summarized as follows.  At plate:  At plate:  Remember: Anode is the electrode where oxidation occurs and cathode is where reduction occurs. OILRIG:  O xydation I s L ossing of electron and R eduction I s G aining of electron.   If a load, R is applied between the electrodes then accumulated negative charges begin to flow from cathode to anode via load as shown in . Due to which other +ve and -ve ions again start migrating towards electrodes to perform chemical reaction. Hence accumulation of charges on the electrodes in a solution and discharging via load are continuous by maintaing the equilibrium condition. The voltage at this time between the electrodes is known as terminal voltage or terminal potential difference as shown in . The difference is called the lost voltage. Lost voltage is proportional to the current or disacharging rate of the electrodes. The straight line shows the ideal case of rate of accumulation of charges on the electrodes. The straight line shows the rate of discharging of electrodes or current through the load. If higher load is applied current decreases on the load depicting line in the graph. The projection of intersection point between rate of charging and rate of discharging on x axis gives the value of terminal potential difference (voltage). The terminal voltage increases with increasing load thus decreases the lost voltage on the internal resistance. Lost voltage occurs due to drop of voltage on internal resistance. See the equation above .   "

Lets calculate the maximum power transfer to the load. Consider a simple circuit as shown in . Now, power generated by the source is given by and power transfered to the load can be From Ohm's law, we have  Hence, from eqns. and we get-   That is, power transfer depends upon the load resistance.

  "title": "Magnetic Materials",
  "body": " Magnetic Materials   The orbital and spin motion of electrons or the interaction of one electron to the other is the origin of magnetism of any materials. Hence all most all materials display magnetic behaviors. On the basis of magnetic behaviors there are three types of materials. They are  Ferromagnetic,  Paramagnetic, and  Diamagnetic.  However, there are three other types of magnetic behaviors also found in nature they are ferrimagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and superparamagnetic which are not the part of discussion here.    Ferromagnetic Material:               It has a very strong magnetization. Magnetization is a physical process of being magnetized when a material is subjected to an external magnetic field. The atomic dipole moments are very strong in these type of materials. Most permanent magnets are ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium. Transition metals and some rare earth metals exhibits ferromagnetic behavior. Unpaired electrons spins in partially filled orbitals gives rise to a local magnetic moment. Actually, unpaired electrons containing atoms are very close to each other (and hence there is strong exchange interactions between them) which creates domains in the crystal structure that have the same direction supporting each other. In ferromagnetic materials magnetic dipoles are aligned in a specific direction in a small group within the materials called a domain . The direction of dipole moments vary from one domain to another which cancels the effect of one another and material does not show any intrinsic specific magnetic behavior. But as the material is exposed to an external magnetic field dipole moments of all domains aligned in the direction of external magnetic field and material behaves like a magnet. Once the dipoles aligned in one direction they retain in the same direction even after removal of external field. Hence the permanent magnets are made out of ferromagnetic materials. Bar magnet, horse shoe magnet, disc magnet, . are some examples of permanent magnets. is an electromagnet whose core is often made from ferromagnetic material.    Paramagnetic Material:  It has a week atomic dipole moment. Unpaired electrons in a partially filled orbitals give rise to a net magnetic moment of atoms but due to thermal agitation the resultant magnetic moment of the materials is zero and hence show no magnetic behavior on its own. Aluminum, magnesium, tungsten, and titanium are some examples of paramagnetic materials. Unpaired electrons in a paramagnetic material are relatively far away from each other hence the exchange interaction is very weak and can not creates any domain. The magnetic moments of such atoms are oriented in random direction and they cancel out each other effect. When subjected to an external magnetic field magnetic moment of the material however, align in a direction to the external filed and starts showing net magnetization. Again, magnetization becomes zero with the removal of external field.    Diamagnetic Material:  This type of materials are composed of atoms that do not possess any net magnetic moments i.e., all the orbitals of atoms are filled and there are no unpaired electrons. Bismuth, copper, lead, mercury, silver, gold, tin, diamond, water, and graphite are some examples of diamagnetic materials. However, when subject to an external field dipole moments induced in a material opposite to external field. Hence diamagnetic materials are deflected away from the magnetic field. The magnetization of such materials becomes zero after removal of external fields.   "

  "body": " Geomagnetism               Geomagnetism is the study of the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field, which is produced in the inner core. The Earth's magnetic field is predominantly a geo-axial dipole, with north and south magnetic poles located near the from the geographic poles that undergo periodic reversals and excursions. The Earth's magnetic field is attributed to a dynamo effect of circulating electric current, but it is not constant in direction. Rock specimens of different ages in similar locations have different directions of permanent magnetization. The circulating electric currents in the Earth's molten metallic core are the cause of the earth's magnetic field. Convection drives the outer-core fluid and it circulates relative to the earth. This means the electrically conducting material moves relative to the earth's magnetic field. If it can obtain a charge by some interaction like friction between layers, an effective current loop could be produced. The magnetic field of a current loop could sustain the magnetic dipole type field of the earth [ ]. The magnitude of magnetic field at the surface of the Earth is about half a Gauss and dips toward the Earth in the northern hemisphere. The magnitude varies over the surface of the Earth in the range 0.3 to 0.6 Gauss.     Magnetic Meridian: An imaginary vertical plane passing through the axis of a freely suspended magnet is called a magnetic meridian. The direction of Earth's magnetic field lies in the magnetic meridian may or may not be horizontal. The vertical plane passing through the geographical axis of Earth is called geographical meridian [ ]. The angle between the magnetic meridian and the geographic meridian at a place is called a magnetic declination, D at that place. At equator it is zero since field is parallel to the earth surface and is maximum at poles. The declination is expressed in degrees East or degrees West For example a declination of means the compass will point 2 degrees east of true geographical North. Thus, the knowledge of declination at a place helps in finding the true geographical directions at that place. The declination at point O is    Magnetic Inclination or magnetic dip is the angle (I) between the horizontal component of earth's magnetic field (H) and the total magnetic field vector Moving closer to magnetic poles results in one side of the compass needle pointing downwards. Between the magnetic poles there is an area called the magnetic equator where inclination or the magnetic dip angle is zero; the magnetic field vector does not have a vertical component in this area. To the north of the magnetic equator, the north end of the compass needle points downward, both I and H are positive. To the south of the magnetic equator, the south end of the needle points downward, that is I and H are both negative.    "

  "body": " Magnetic Flux,   The number of magnetic field lines passing through any surface area perpendicularly is known as a magnetic flux. Its unit is Weber (wb). It is a scalar quantity. However, the flux per unit area describes a magnetic field .      Consider a small area is placed at any point P in space through which field lines are passing normally as shown in , then the magnetic field B is given by  where is the angle between and . Hence the total magnetic flux through that area is given by                 There are three ways to change magnetic flux  change the size of area [ ];  change the magnitude of magnetic field [ ]; and  change the orientation of plane [ ].      Gauss's Law for Magnetism  The net magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero, ie., This statement is based on the experimental fact that isolated magnetic poles (monopoles) never exist and that all magnetic fields are actually generated by circulating currents. The number of magnetic field-lines entering any closed surface is always equal to the number of field-lines leaving that surface. Thus, magnetic field-lines behave in a quite different manner to electric field-lines, which begin on positive charges, end on negative charges, and never form closed loops.    Velocity Selector      A velocity selector velocity selector is a region where a uniform electric field, is perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, and both are perpendicular to the initial velocity, of the charged particles. The force exerted on a charged particle by the electric field is and the force exerted by the magnetic field is as long as the velocity is perpendicular to the field. If the two forces are equal and opposite, the net force and the particle passes through the region without changing direction. However, magnetic force is velocity dependent hence when charges traveling faster or slower than the ones that go straight through will be deflected oneway or another out of the beam as shown in . The cross in a circle representing the magnetic field is going into the paper . If a positive charge moves into a magnetic field with direction perpendicular to the field, it will follow a circular path where magnetic force provides a necessary centripetal force, i.e., Magnetic force acting on a charge particle is always perpendicular to the velocity of the charge in a uniform magnetic field hence, it takes a circular path. For a particle moving in a gravitational field, acquires vertical and horizontal components of velocity and hence starts moving in a parabolic path. If the projectlie has sufficient horizontal velocity then it also starts rotating around the planet in a circular path. Gravitational force and field are acting along the same direction but this is not the case for magnetic force and field. ; but .     This principle is applied in mass spectrometer to seperate of heavy ions (or, isotopes) from lighter ones. If  then charge moves without deflection along x axis. If then increases and the charge deflects along +y axis and follow the upward circular track. If then decreases and the charge deflects along -y axis and follow the downward citcular track.    Cyclotron Frequency  The cyclotron cyclotron is a device for accelerating ions in a constant magnetic field by the repeated application of accelerating potentials. A cyclotron consists of two hollow semicircular electrodes, called dees , mounted back to back, separated by a narrow gap, in an evacuated chamber between the poles of a magnet. An electric field, alternating in polarity, is created in the gap by a radio-frequency oscillator.      The positive ions produced from a source at the center are accelerated by a dee which is at the negative potential at that moment. Due to the presence of magnetic field (pointed into the page) the ions will move in a circular path inside the dees. The magnetic field and the frequency of applied voltage are so adjusted that as the ion comes out of a dee, the dees change their polarity (+ve dee becomes -ve and vice-versa) and the ion is further accelerated and moves with higher velocity along a circular path of greater radius as shown in . Once the ion reaches to the periphery of the dees it gets deflected out from the dees to bombard a target.  Suppose the positive ion having charge moves in a dee with a velocity , then magnetic force = centripetal force, i.e.,  where is the mass of ion, is the radius of the path of ion in a dee, and is the magnetic field strength. The angular velcity of the ion is given by, The time taken by the ion in describing a semi circle, ie., to turning by an angle is,  Hence the time taken by an ion in a dee is constant and is independent upon its velocity and radius. From eqn. it is clear if is known for any ion then can be calculated for producing resonance with the high frequency alternating potential source, i.e., the frequency of alternating source can be     Mass Spectrometer      It is an instrument used to measure the masses of ions. The principle behind mass spectrometry mass spectrometer is that a charged particle passing through a magnetic field is deflected along a circular path on a radius that is proportional to the mass to charge ratio, Ions are accelerated through the region between electric potentials and enter into the uniform magnetic field where it follows the circular path and falls at different location depends upon it mass as shown in .    Hall Effect      When an electrical current passes through a conductor placed in a magnetic field, a potential proportional to the current and to the magnetic field is developed across the material in a direction perpendicular to both the current and to the magnetic field. This effect is known as the Hall effect Hall effect . The magnetic field exerts a transverse force on the moving charge carriers which tends to push them to one side of the conductor and develops a potential difference across the conductor known as Hall voltage as shown in . Hall effect is very useful in determining types of charge carriers in a semiconductor.   "

  "body": " Magnetic Field of a Moving Charge:         Permeability of Free Space,  The property of space which permit magnetic flux to pass through it is known as permeability. It is a measure of relative increase or decrease in the resultant magnetic field inside a material compared with the magnetizing field H in which the given material is located. It is a constant of proportionality that exists between magnetic induction (magnetic flux density) B and magnetic field intensity (magnetizing field) H. For free space   Materials may be classified magnetically on the basis of their permeabilities. Materials that cause the lines of flux to move farther apart, resulting in a decrease in magnetic flux density compared with a vacuum, are called diamagnetic . Materials that concentrate magnetic flux by a factor of more than 1 but less than or equal to 10 are called paramagnetic ; materials that concentrate the flux by a factor of more than 10 are called ferromagnetic . The permeability factors of some substances change with rising or falling temperature, or with the intensity of the applied magnetic field. Permeability is often expressed in relative, rather than in absolute, terms. If be the permeability of free space, be the permeability of the given substance, then the relative permeability, , is given by:     Magnetic Field of a Current Element (Biot Savart Law)        Magnetic Field of a straight wire                   Consider a current carrying straight conductor of length 2a. To find a magnetic field at a point P from the conductor consider a small current element on a conductor and use Biot-Savart's law, The direction of magnetic field at P is given by right hand grip rule which is going into the plane of the paper. is unit vector along and is angle between current element and line joining the current element to point P.    Now solve the integrand first with the help of geometry of the figure then substitute the value to obtain B.              When (ie., for infinitely long wire) then , hence     When then , hence       Magnetic field due to a current loop   on axis of Coil with N turns. at center of Coil with N turns. Magnetic field at a point P due to a current element is given by From Biot-Savart's law and is directed normal to the plane subtends by and . angle between and is        Due to symmetry of current along the ring y components of field cancel out but x component survived, hence     If number of turns in a circular loop is N, then along the x-axis.  Magnetic field at the center (ie., x=0) of a current carrying loop is     Magnetic field at the center of a Helmholtz coil  Helmholtz coils consist of two similar co-axial coils A and B having same radius, same number of turns, and placed parallel to each other at a distance equal to their radii as shown in . When the coils are connected in such a way that the current flows through the coils in the same direction, then Helmholtz coils produce nearly uniform magnetic field over a considerable region between the coils.      Magnetic field at the axial point at a distance x from the center of the coil of radius a, number of turns N, and carrying current I is given by along x-axis.  The rate of variation of magnetic field B along x-axis is given by   For uniform variation of , must be constant and must be zero. Hence,    Thus, the rate of variation of magnetic field is constant at distance from the center of the coil. Therefore on either side of point P, the field due to one coil decreases uniformly, while that due to another is increases uniformly. Since both the coils are identical and carry the same amount of current in same direction the decrease in field due to one coil is balanced by the increase in field by another one. Hence overall magnetic field remains uniform over a considerable region on either side of the point P. The resultant magnetic field B between the region of coils are obtained by substituting the value of in eqn. . We have       Magnetic field at a point due to current carrying solenoid  Solenoid is a long wire wound in a closed-packed helix which behaves as a magnet when carrying an electric current. Magnetic field is directed along the axis of solenoid and can be determined by right hand grip rule [ ].  Consider a solenoid of radius a, number of turns per unit length n and a length of current element so that total number of turns in strip ABCD is . If current I is flowing through a solenoid then the field at point P due to current element is given by       from eqn.  From           For an infinitely long solenoid, Hence, If point P is at the end of a solenoid, Hence, Thus for a long solenoid the magnetic field at the ends is half of that at the middle of the solenoid.

The induced emf resulting from a changing magnetic flux has a polarity that leads to an induced current whose direction is such that the induced magnetic field opposes the original flux change.  When the magnetic flux is increasing, a magnetic field opposing to the increasing field is generated by induced current.  When the magnetic flux is decreasing, a magnetic field in the same direction as the decreasing field is generated by the induced current.    "

  "title": "Induced Electric Fields",
  "body": " Induced Electric Fields       Eddy Currents  When a conductor is moved in a magnetic field, there is a force on the electrons, which then move in the metal. This movement is called an eddy current. The induced currents produce magnetic fields which tend to oppose the motion of the metal. An eddy current is a swirling current set up in a conductor in response to a changing magnetic field. According to Lenz's law the current swirls in the conductor in such a way that it opposes the changing magnetic field. To do so in a conductor, electrons swirl in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. As the metal enters into the magnetic field, flux starts increasing so to oppose this flux electrons of metal make loop in such a way that the induced current has magnetic field opposing the increase. As the metal plate begins leaving the magnetic field current loops on metal surface just in opposite direction to the previous loops as shown in .      Because of the tendency to oppose, eddy currents cause energy to be lost. Due to eddy currents kinetic energy transforms into heat energy. One of the practical applications of eddy currents is magnetic braking . During braking, the metal wheels are exposed to a magnetic field from an electromagnet, generating eddy currents in the wheels. The magnetic interaction between the applied field and the eddy currents acts to slow the wheels down. The faster the wheels are spinning, the stronger the effect, meaning that as the train slows the braking force is reduced, producing a smooth stopping motion.  French physicist Leon Foucault in 1855 discovered eddy currents. He found that the force needed to rotate a copper disk when its rim is placed between the poles of a magnet, such as a horseshoe magnet, increases and the disk is heated by the induced eddy currents.  The heating effect originates from the transformation of electric energy into heat energy and is used in induction heating devices, like some cookers and welders. The resistance felt by the eddy currents in a conductor causes Joule heating and he amount of heat generated is proportional to the current squared. However, for applications like motors, generators and transformers, this heat is considered wasted energy and as such, eddy currents need to be minimized. This can be achieved by laminating the metal cores of these devices, where each core is made up of multiple insulated sheets of metal. This splits the core in many individual magnetic circuits and restricts the flow of the eddy currents through it, reducing the amount of heat generated through Joule heating.  Eddy currents can also be removed by cracks or slits in the conductor, which break the circuit and prevent the current loops from circulating. This means that eddy currents can be used to detect defects in materials. This is called nondestructive testing and is often used in airplanes. The magnetic field produced by the eddy currents is measured, where a change in the field reveals the presence of an irregularity; a defect will reduce the size of the eddy current, which in turn reduces the magnetic field strength.    Generator  A generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. As Faraday's law holds good for any shape of conductor moving in a magnetic field, this principle can be used to design electric dynamo or generator where a loop is rataing in a magnetic field.               Consider a closed rectangular loop C of number of turns N, area of each loop is A rotating in a uniform magnetic field B with angular velocity . As the loop rotates, the flux linked with the coil changes and an emf is induced in the coil. Suppose at any instant the normal to plane of loop is making an angle with the magnetic field B, then magnetic flux linked with loop at that time is given by    where = maximum emf.  If this loop is part of a circuit, this emf will induce an Alternating Current (AC) in the circuit. If R is the resistance of the circuit, the induced current in the circuit is given by where is the amplitude of the ac current.    Skin Effect  When a steady current flows through a wire, it is distributed uniformly over the entire cross-section of the wire. On the other hand, when an alternating current flows through the a wire, it is concentrated mostly near the outer surface of wire rather than the uniform distribution. This effect is called skin effect of alternating current. The skin effect increases with increasing frequency. In case of very high frequency current is almost wholly confined to the surface layer of the wire. This is the reason in ac transmission current carrier wire is made out of collection of many thin insulated stranded wires rather than one thick single wire. Electromagnetic induction is the cause of skin effect.    Superconductivity  Superconductivity is a phenomenon that conduct electricity in an element, inter-metallic alloy, or compound without resistance when it is kept below a certain temperature and magnetic field   Emf of Moving Conductor:   rod with everything perpendicular.
