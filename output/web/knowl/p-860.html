<div class="para">A plane mirror is a highly smoothed flat surface or a glass plate. One side of the  plate is silver coated and is called a <em class="emphasis">silvered surface</em>, another side of it is highly smoothed (fine polished) from which light beam undergoes a regular reflection to form an image and is called a <em class="emphasis">reflecting surface</em> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pimage.html" title="Figure 5.2.4.(a)">FigureÂ 5.2.4.(a)</a>. In other words, if a reflecting surface is  plane or if radius of curvature of the surface is infinite then it behaves like a mirror, and is called a <dfn class="terminology">plane mirror</dfn>. Any thing from which light rays emanate and incident to the mirror is called an <dfn class="terminology">object</dfn>. The reflected rays from the mirror either actually converge to a point or appear to diverge from a point. The point of intersection of reflected rays is called an <dfn class="terminology">image</dfn>.</div>
