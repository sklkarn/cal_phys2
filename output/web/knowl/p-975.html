<div class="para">A rainbow can be seen in the sky when an observer facing opposite to the sun look at about <span class="process-math">\(42^o\)</span> above the horizon to suspended water droplets. Each individual droplet of water acts as a tiny prism that both disperses the light and reflects it back to the observer’s eye. As you sight into the sky, wavelengths of light associated with a specific color arrive at your eye from the collection of droplets as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/rainbow.html" title="Figure 5.3.6">Figure 5.3.6</a>. The net effect of the vast array of droplets is that a circular arc of <em class="emphasis">VIBGYOR</em> is seen across the sky. A rainbow is actually a complete circle but observers on the ground only view the top half of the circle since the bottom half of the circular arc is prevented by the presence of the ground. However, observers in an airborne plane can view the complete circular bow. Rainbows are not limited to the dispersion of light by raindrops. The splashing of water in front of you forms water mist in the air and if you are facing opposite to the sun then the chances are you can create your own rainbows. Bright sunlight, suspended water droplets and the proper angle of sighting are the three necessary components for viewing one of nature’s most spectacular activities.</div>
