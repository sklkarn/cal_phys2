<dfn class="terminology">Rise of current</dfn> Consider a circuit containing an inductor of self-inductance L, resistance R, and a battery of constant emf E is connected with the switch s. As soon as the switch is connected to the battery current begins to flow and magnetic flux is linked with the coil. As a result a self induced emf is set up in the coil which opposes the rise of current in the circuit. Hence the current does not attain its final steady value <span class="process-math">\(i_{o}\)</span> instantaneously.</div>
