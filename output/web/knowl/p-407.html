<div class="para">When an electrical current passes through a conductor placed in a magnetic field, a potential proportional to the current and to the magnetic field is developed across the material in a direction perpendicular to both the current and to the magnetic field. This effect is known as the Hall effect . The magnetic field exerts a transverse force on the moving charge carriers which tends to push them to one side of the conductor and develops a potential difference across the conductor known as <em class="emphasis">Hall voltage</em> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/hall.html" title="Figure 3.1.13">FigureÂ 3.1.13</a>. Hall effect is very useful in determining types of charge carriers in a semiconductor.</div>
