<div class="para">It has a week atomic dipole moment. Unpaired electrons in a partially filled orbitals give rise to a net magnetic moment of atoms but due to thermal agitation the resultant magnetic moment of the materials is zero and hence show no magnetic behavior on its own. Aluminum, magnesium, tungsten, and titanium are some examples of paramagnetic materials. Unpaired electrons in a paramagnetic material are relatively far away from each other hence the exchange interaction is very weak and can not creates any domain. The magnetic moments of such atoms are oriented in random direction and they cancel out each other effect. When subjected to an external magnetic field magnetic moment of the material however, align in a direction to the external filed and starts showing net magnetization. Again, magnetization becomes zero with the removal of external field.</div>
