<div class="para">The phenomenon of splitting of white light into its constituent colors when passes through a prism is known as <dfn class="terminology">dispersion</dfn> and the image thus formed on a screen is called a <dfn class="terminology">spectrum</dfn>. The spectrum consists of a visible and invisible regions of light. The principal colors of light in the visible spectrum are given as <em class="emphasis">VIBGYOR</em> (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red). The deviation occurred in violet light is maximum and that for red light is minimum as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/dispers.html" title="Figure 5.3.1">FigureÂ 5.3.1</a>. In the invisible regions, the spectrum of wavelengths shorter than violet is called <em class="emphasis">ultra-violet</em> and that for longer than red is called <em class="emphasis">infra-red</em>.</div>
