<dfn class="terminology">Magnetic Meridian:</dfn> An imaginary vertical plane passing through the axis of a freely suspended magnet is called a magnetic meridian. The direction of Earth’s magnetic field lies in the magnetic meridian may or may not be horizontal. The vertical plane passing through the  geographical axis of Earth is called geographical meridian [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/diclination.html" title="Figure 3.1.5.(b)">Figure 3.1.5.(b)</a>]. The angle between the magnetic meridian and the geographic meridian at a place is called a <dfn class="terminology">magnetic declination, D</dfn> at that place. At equator it is zero since field is parallel to the earth surface and is maximum at poles. The declination is expressed in degrees East <span class="process-math">\((^{o} E)\)</span> or degrees West <span class="process-math">\((^{o} W).\)</span> For example a declination of <span class="process-math">\(2^{o} E\)</span> means the compass will point 2 degrees east of true geographical North. Thus, the knowledge of declination at a place helps in finding the true geographical directions at that place. The declination at point O is <span class="process-math">\(D^{o}E.\)</span>

<dfn class="terminology">Magnetic Inclination</dfn> or <em class="emphasis">magnetic dip</em> is the angle (I) between the horizontal component of earth’s magnetic field (H) and the total magnetic field vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B}.\)</span> Moving closer to magnetic poles results in one side of the compass needle pointing downwards. Between the magnetic poles there is an area called the magnetic equator where inclination or the magnetic dip angle is zero; the magnetic field vector does not have a vertical component <span class="process-math">\((V)\)</span> in this area. To the north of the magnetic equator, the north end of the compass needle points downward, both I and H are positive. To the south of the magnetic equator, the south end of the needle points downward, that is I and H are both negative.</div></li>
