<div class="para">Direct current in a circuit can be controlled by a resistance only, but to control alternating current resistance, inductance, and capacitance can also be used. In alternating current the ratio of potential difference across the circuit to the current flowing through it is known as <dfn class="terminology">impedance, Z</dfn> where</div>

<div class="para">Physically impedance in ac (alternating current) circuit is the resistance offered by it in the flow of alternating current just as the resistance in the flow of direct current in the dc circuit. The resistance offered by the inductance and capacitance to the flow of alternating current in the ac circuit is known as the <dfn class="terminology">Reactance, X</dfn>.
