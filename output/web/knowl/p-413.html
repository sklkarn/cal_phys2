<div class="para">A solenoid [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/solenoid.html" title="Figure 3.2.2">FigureÂ 3.2.2</a>] is a tightly wound helical coil of wire whose diameter is small compared to its length. The magnetic field generated inside the current carrying solenoid is essentially uniform, and is directed along the axis of the solenoid. Outside the solenoid, the magnetic field is very weak. The winding of wire is sufficiently tight that each turn of the solenoid is well approximated as a circular wire loop, lying in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the solenoid, which carries a current I. If a solenoid of length l has total number of turns N then the magnetic field (i.e. total magnetic moments) along the axis of a solenoid is  given by <span class="process-math">\(\mu = N I A\text{.}\)</span>
