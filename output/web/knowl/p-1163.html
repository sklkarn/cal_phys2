<div class="para">Consider A and B are two virtual coherent sources which produce a central bright fringe at point C. When a transparent plate G of thickness t and refractive index <span class="process-math">\(\eta\)</span> is introduced in the path of one of the beams, the fringe at C shifts to another point P as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/interplatethick.html" title="Figure 5.8.4">FigureÂ 5.8.4</a>. The time taken by the wave from B to P in air is the same as the time taken by the wave from A to P partly through air and partly through the plate. Suppose c and v are the velocity of light in air and in plate, respectively, then</div>
