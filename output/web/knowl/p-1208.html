<div class="para">If the ordinary light is passed through these crystals when they are rotating in such a way that their axes are always parallel then no change has been observed in the light coming out of crystal B, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/polr3a.html" title="Figure 5.8.18.(a)">Figure 5.8.18.(a)</a>. On the other hand, if crystal A is fixed and crystal B is rotated with respect to A then light transmitted through B becomes dimmer gradually and no light is emerges out of B when it is perpendicular to A, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/polr3b.html" title="Figure 5.8.18.(b)">Figure 5.8.18.(b)</a>. If B is further rotated then light intensity increases gradually and becomes maximum when B becomes parallel to A again. This experiment concludes that light is not propagated as longitudinal waves rather it is transverse in nature otherwise it could never be extinguished by simply rotating crystal B.</div>
