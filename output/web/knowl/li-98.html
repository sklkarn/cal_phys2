<div class="para">Because <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> is constant in this small region of space, due to symmetry the electric field must be perpendicular to the surface of the conductor and constant at a distance d from the surface. Consider a cylindrical Gaussian surface as shown in given figures. Surfaces <span class="process-math">\(S_{1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_{2}\)</span> are parallel to the conducting plane and surface <span class="process-math">\(S_{3}\)</span> is cylindrical surface  perpendicular to the conductorâ€™s surface and parallel to electric field as shown in figure below.</div>

<div class="para">For a conductor electric field is only out side of the conductor but within it electric field is zero as shown in figure at right. In charged conductors the excess charges have distributed themselves optimally further away from one another so as to reduce the total amount of repulsive forces. Once a charged conductor has reached the state of electrostatic equilibrium, there is no further motion of charge about the surface as shown in figure below.</div>
