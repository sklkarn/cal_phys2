<div class="para">Two wave sources are said to be <dfn class="terminology">coherent</dfn> if they emit light waves of  same frequency (i.e. same wavelength), same amplitude, and in a constant phase difference with each other. In practice, it is not possible to have two independent sources which are coherent. A source of light consists of a large number of atoms and light pulse is emitted when an electron from higher energy levels falls onto a lower energy levels in an excited atom. The emission of light pulse from various atoms is random and hence such light pulses do not have constant phase relationship.</div>
