In other words, permittivity is the extent to which a medium permits electrical lines of force between the charges. It is a resistance of a medium in forming electric fields. It describes the effect of a material in an electrical field. The higher the permittivity, the more the material tends to reduce electrical field (due to polarization) that set up it.</div>
