<div class="para">A current which can only flow in a circuit in the same direction without changing the polarity is called a <em class="emphasis">direct current</em>. The current due to battery is one of the examples of direct current. On the other hand when current changes direction periodically from positive to negative is called an <em class="emphasis">alternating current</em>. In alternating current the flow of charge also reverses its direction back and forth with time. As a result, the voltage level also reverses along with the current. The current due to dynamo and electro-mechanical generator are some of the  sources of alternating current (AC). AC is used to deliver power to houses, office buildings, etc. because of low loss of energy. The alternating emf is represented as</div>
