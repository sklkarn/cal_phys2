<div class="para">On the otherhand, <span class="process-math">\(SO_{4}^{--}\)</span> ion attracts towards <span class="process-math">\(Pb\)</span> electrode, dumps its negative charges on it and becomes <span class="process-math">\(SO_{4} \)</span> radical which instantly reacts with <span class="process-math">\(Pb\)</span> to form <span class="process-math">\(PbSO_{4}\text{.}\)</span> In this case <span class="process-math">\(Pb\)</span> electrode starts accumulating <span class="process-math">\(-ve\)</span>  charges and becomes a <span class="process-math">\(- \)</span> plate of the cell. This process continues till sufficient charges accumulate on these electrodes and it is difficult for the other ions to migrate towards these electrodes because of electrostatic repulsion between the same charges. When transferring of charges by the ions to their respective electrodes stop then <span class="process-math">\(+\)</span> electrode has accumated maximum positive <span class="process-math">\(+ve \)</span> charge and <span class="process-math">\(- \)</span> electrode has accumulated maximum negative <span class="process-math">\(-ve \)</span> charge. This condition builds up maximum potential difference between the electrodes which is known as electromottife force, <em class="emphasis">emf</em>. The name emf is misleading but it came from its founder, "<em class="emphasis">Alessandro Volta</em>" who had used this term as the real reason behind the motion of these charges in the external circuit was not known. The chemical reactions on the electrodes are summarized as follows.</div>
