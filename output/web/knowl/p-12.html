<div class="para">It is a branch of physics which deals with the charge at rest. Ancient Greeks discovered that when silk is rubbed with amber (a dry tree resin) then both gain the attractive property and attract lightweight small particles. Rubbing glass rod with silk, glass rod becomes +vely charged, and silk becomes -vely charged. Rubbing rubber rod or ebonite rod with fur provides +ve charge to fur and -ve charge to rubber. When two things are rubbed together charge can transfer from one object to another which alters the charge neutrality of materials and gives rise to attractive or repulsive property in the materials. Electrostatic is a phenomenon that arises due to force between the charges. These forces can be determined by Coulomb’s law. It has been inferred from many experimental evidences such as Farady’s law of electrolysis, Milikan’s oil drop experiment, pair production, and pair annihilation that charge is a fundamental property of elementary particles that make up the matter and the smallest possible charge that can acquire on a material is a charge of an electron. The basic properties of charge are given as -</div>
