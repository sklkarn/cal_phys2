<div class="para">A lens is a part of solid spherical refracting surfaces. If its thickness is very thin it is called a thin lens. It is mainly of two types, concave lens and convex lens. The property of lens depends upon its shape and the type of material it is made up off. The lens which consists of two inward curved surfaces is known as <dfn class="terminology">concave lens</dfn> and that which consists of two outward bulged surfaces is known as <dfn class="terminology">convex lens</dfn>. However the combination of types of surfaces gives a lens different shapes. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lens.html" title="Figure 5.2.32">FigureÂ 5.2.32</a> are biconvex lens, plano-convex lens, concavo-convex lens, biconcave lens, plano-concavelens, and convexo-concave lens, respectively. Convex lenses are thicker at the middle and thinner at the edges and concave lenses are thinner at the middle and thicker at the edges.</div>
