<div class="para">The point on the principle axis where the incident light rays parallel to the principle axis after refraction from the lens will converge on or appear to diverge from  is known as <em class="emphasis">focus</em> or focal point of a lens. Two foci exist in a lens, equidistant on either side of the lens, since light behaves the same way when traveling in either direction (Principle of Reversibility). The two foci, <span class="process-math">\(F_{1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F_{2}\)</span> are called the primary principal focus and the secondary principal focus, respectively. An imaginary plane that is perpendicular to the principal axis at the focal point is known as <em class="emphasis">focal plane</em>. The size of a lens is known as <em class="emphasis">aperture</em>. The distance between the optical center, O to the center of curvature is known as <em class="emphasis">radius of curvature, R</em> and the distance between optical center, O to the focal point of a lens is known as <em class="emphasis">focal length, f</em>. The focal length, f is taken as positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. The radius of curvature, R is positive for convex surface and negative for concave surface. The shape of surface can be defined from which surface is the light incident.</div>
