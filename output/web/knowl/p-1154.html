<div class="para">In amplitude division coherent sources are formed by dividing the amplitude of wave by multiple reflection and refraction by a thin transparent film. A ray of light gets partly reflected as ray <span class="process-math">\(A_{1}\)</span> and partly refracted when incident on a thin transparent film. At the point of incidence the refracted ray is again partly reflected and emerges out from the upper surface as ray <span class="process-math">\(A_{2}\text{.}\)</span> At every stage of reflection and refraction the intensity of light decreases. Now, intensity is proportional to square of amplitude hence at each stage amplitude is divided. Since, both rays have been obtained from a single ray, they are coherent as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/coherent2.html" title="Figure 5.8.2.(b)">FigureÂ 5.8.2.(b)</a>.</div>
