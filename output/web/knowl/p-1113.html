<div class="para">The brightness of a surface depends on the reflecting power of the surface and it is not the same as the intensity of illumination. For example,</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">The brightness of a white chalk on the blackboard is very high as compared to the black polish on the board, but the intensity of illumination of the white chalk and black polish is the same.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If the two opposite walls of a room are painted with white paint and red paint, respectively then the wall with white paint appears brighter than the red wall. However, the intensity of illumination of both the walls is same as the amount of luminous flux per square cm incident on each wall is the same.</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">Due to these reasons, the brightness of a surface is defined as the luminous flux per sq. cm. coming out of the surface after reflection. If I is the intensity of illumination and R is the reflecting power of the surface, then the brightness of the surface = RI.</div>
