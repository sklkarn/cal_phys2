<div class="para">In this defect, objects far from eye appear clear and that near eye appears blurred. When objects are  far from eye eyelens can stretch enough to become sufficiently thinner and achieve longer focal length to produce image on retina. When objects lie near eye eyelens cannot contract enough to become thicker and  achieve shorter focal length to produce image at retina and hence the image is formed behind the retina as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/hyperopia.html" title="Figure 5.6.6.(a)">Figure 5.6.6.(a)</a>. Actually, when objects lie anywhere between infinity to new near point N’ eye can accommodate itself for clear vision but produces image behind the retina to any objects near than point N’. To correct myopic eye a convex lens of suitable focal length can be used as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/hyperopia2.html" title="Figure 5.6.6.(b)">Figure 5.6.6.(b)</a>.</div>
