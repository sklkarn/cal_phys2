<div class="para">Consider a ray AP from the sun is incident at point P  in a spherical water droplet and refracts along PQ. If the angle of incidence of ray PQ at point P is greater than the critical angle for water air interface then light gets internally reflected along QR from the back surface of drop and may emerge into the air at the point R as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/rainbowb.html" title="Figure 5.4.7">FigureÂ 5.4.7</a>. During this operation the deviation suffered by the ray of light is given by the <span class="process-math">\(\angle MON=\phi\text{,}\)</span> since the line MO is parallel to the incident ray AP and line ON is parallel to the emergent ray RB. Note that the absorption, reflection, and refraction happen in light at each point it strikes on the surface of droplet. From figure at left,</div>
