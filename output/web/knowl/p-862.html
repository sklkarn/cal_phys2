<div class="para">When an object, O is placed in front of a plane mirror, MN an image I is formed behind the mirror. To determine how an image is formed, we need to consider at least two light rays that emanate from the object, O. Consider the ray, OA which makes an angle of incidence, i with the normal to the mirror. By the law of reflection, this ray is reflected along AB such that the angle of reflection is r. When these reflected light rays enters into the observerâ€™s eye it appears to have come from behind the mirror from point, I as indicated by the dashed line. The second incident ray, OC is reflected along CD. To an observer in front of the mirror at D this reflected ray also appears to come from the same point I behind the mirror, as indicated by the dashed line. The two reflected  rays appear to have come from the point I  behind the mirror where the two dashed lines intersect. The point I is called the image of the object O.  The distance from the image to the mirror is called the image distance and is designated by the letter q. The image is called a virtual image because the light rays do not actually come from that point, they only appear to come from that point. If you were to walk behind the mirror, you would not find any real image there. A real image can be projected onto a screen while a virtual image cannot. In general, a real image is one on which all the rays are converging, while a virtual image is one from which all the rays are diverging. Thus, rays AB and CD are diverging away from the virtual image I and will never cross on the left-hand side of the mirror. We should also note that there is a third ray that can be used. This is the ray that is perpendicular to the mirror. Since its angle of incidence is zero, its reflected angle is also zero, and the ray is reflected back along the normal. This ray appears to come from directly behind the mirror and is also indicated by a dashed line that comes from the image point I.</div>
