<div class="para">The center of a sphere of which a mirror is a part is called a <dfn class="terminology">center of curvature, C</dfn>. An imaginary line passing through the center of curvature of a spherical mirror is called the <dfn class="terminology">principal axis</dfn> or optical axis of the mirror. Principle axis is a symmetrical line of the mirror. The point on the surface of mirror through which a principle axis is passing is called a <dfn class="terminology">pole, P</dfn> or vertex of the mirror. The radius of a sphere of which a mirror is a part is called the <dfn class="terminology">radius of curvature, R</dfn> of the mirror. Radius of curvature is a distance between pole of the mirror to the center of curvature of the mirror.</div>
