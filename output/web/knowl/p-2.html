<div class="para">I would like to thank my colleagues and students for the contributions they have made to improve this book through questionnaires, classroom discussion, and their invaluable feedback and support throughout the writing process. I am especially very grateful to John Gould and Daniel Covington for providing their critical suggestions to organize this book. Without their guidance, this book would not be what it is today. Their knowledge and expertise were instrumental in shaping my journey in writing this book. Finally, I want to express my gratitude to my family for their unwavering encouragement and patience during the many long hours I spent at my desk. Their love and support sustained me through the ups and downs of this project. Several others deserve credit for their generous help in this book.</div>
