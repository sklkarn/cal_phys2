<div class="para">A sunlight is allowed to pass through a pinhole S and then at some distance away on two other pinholes <span class="process-math">\(S_{1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_{2}\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/youngs2.html" title="Figure 5.8.1">Figure 5.8.1</a>.  <span class="process-math">\(S_{1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_{2}\)</span> are equidistant from S and are very close to each other. When a spherical wavefront from S reaches to  <span class="process-math">\(S_{1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_{2}\)</span> it distributed into two separate wavefronts of identical in nature (Huygen’s principle). When these wavefronts superimpose to each other on the screen dark and bright bands can be observed clearly. The point such as O on the screen is bright because the crest of one wave falls on the crest of another (or trough of one falls on the trough of the other). Hence they reinforce each other. The points such as P are dark because the crest of one wave falls on the trough of the other wave and they neutralize the effect of each other.</div>
