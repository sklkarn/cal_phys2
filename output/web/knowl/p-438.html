<div class="para">The property of space which permit magnetic flux to pass through it is known as permeability. It is a measure of relative increase or decrease in the resultant magnetic field inside a material compared with the magnetizing field H in which the given material is located. It is a constant of proportionality that exists between magnetic induction (magnetic flux density) B and magnetic field intensity (magnetizing field) H. For free space</div>

<div class="para">Materials may be classified magnetically on the basis of their permeabilities. Materials that cause the lines of flux to move farther apart, resulting in a decrease in magnetic flux density compared with a vacuum, are called <dfn class="terminology">diamagnetic</dfn>. Materials that concentrate magnetic flux by a factor of more than 1 but less than or equal to 10 are called <dfn class="terminology">paramagnetic</dfn>; materials that concentrate the flux by a factor of more than 10 are called <dfn class="terminology">ferromagnetic</dfn>. The  permeability factors of some substances change with rising or falling temperature, or with the intensity of the applied magnetic field. Permeability is often expressed in relative, rather than in absolute, terms. If <span class="process-math">\(\mu_{o}\)</span> be the permeability of free space, <span class="process-math">\(\mu\)</span> be the permeability of the given substance, then the relative permeability, <span class="process-math">\(\mu_{r} \text{,}\)</span> is given by:</div>

\mu_{r} = \frac{\mu}{\mu_{o}}
