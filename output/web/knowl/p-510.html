<div class="para">When a steady current flows through a wire, it is distributed uniformly over the entire cross-section of the wire. On the other hand, when an alternating current flows through the a wire, it is concentrated mostly near the outer surface of wire rather than the uniform distribution. This effect is called skin effect of alternating current. The skin effect increases with increasing frequency. In case of very high frequency current is almost wholly confined to the surface layer of the wire. This is the reason in ac transmission current carrier wire is made out of collection of many thin insulated stranded wires rather than one thick single wire. Electromagnetic induction is the cause of skin effect.</div>
