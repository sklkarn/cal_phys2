<div class="para">When a conductor is moved in a magnetic field, there is a force on the electrons, which then move in the metal. This movement is called an eddy current. The induced currents produce magnetic fields which tend to oppose the motion of the metal. An eddy current is a swirling current set up in a conductor in response to a changing magnetic field. According to Lenz’s law the current swirls in the conductor in such a way that it opposes the changing magnetic field. To do so in a conductor, electrons swirl in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. As the metal enters into the magnetic field, flux starts increasing so to oppose this flux electrons of metal make loop in such a way that the induced current has magnetic field opposing the increase. As the metal plate begins leaving the magnetic field current loops on metal surface just in opposite direction to the previous loops as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eddy.html" title="Figure 3.7.2">Figure 3.7.2</a>.</div>
