<dfn class="terminology">Magnetic Inclination</dfn> or <em class="emphasis">magnetic dip</em> is the angle (I) between the horizontal component of earthâ€™s magnetic field (H) and the total magnetic field vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B}.\)</span> Moving closer to magnetic poles results in one side of the compass needle pointing downwards. Between the magnetic poles there is an area called the magnetic equator where inclination or the magnetic dip angle is zero; the magnetic field vector does not have a vertical component <span class="process-math">\((V)\)</span> in this area. To the north of the magnetic equator, the north end of the compass needle points downward, both I and H are positive. To the south of the magnetic equator, the south end of the needle points downward, that is I and H are both negative.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="subsec-geo_mag.html#li-462" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
