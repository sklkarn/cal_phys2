<div class="para">A healthy human eye can see objects clearly  as close as 25 cm from  the eye. This distance is called a least distance of distinct vision, D and the point is called a <dfn class="terminology">near point</dfn> N as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eyeaccn.html" title="Figure 5.6.4.(a)">Figure 5.6.4.(a)</a>. A far point for healthy human eye is considered at infinity as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eyeaccf.html" title="Figure 5.6.4.(b)">Figure 5.6.4.(b)</a>. If there exists any problem in the accommodation process, then the eyes are called suffering from defects of vision. For example, if the ciliary muscles do not contract or stretch as it supposed to be then our eye unable to focus the light at retina to privide clear vision. There are many other reasons which may be responsible for defects of vision. The common two types of defects of vision, myopia (short sightedness) and hypermetropia (far sightedness) are being discussed here.</div>
