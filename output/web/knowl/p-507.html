<div class="para">The heating effect originates from the transformation of electric energy into heat energy and is used in induction heating devices, like some cookers and welders. The resistance felt by the eddy currents in a conductor causes Joule heating and he amount of heat generated is proportional to the current squared. However, for applications like motors, generators and transformers, this heat is considered wasted energy and as such, eddy currents need to be minimized. This can be achieved by laminating the metal cores of these devices, where each core is made up of multiple insulated sheets of metal. This splits the core in many individual magnetic circuits and restricts the flow of the eddy currents through it, reducing the amount of heat generated through Joule heating.</div>
