<div class="para">It is a branch of physics which deals with magnets and magnetic properties of materials. It defines the magnetic behavior of material which is associated with the motion of an electric charge. The motion of charges in a conductor or in space gives rise to magnetic fields and magnetism is a result of magnetic fields. The word <em class="emphasis">magnet</em> is taken from Latin word <span class="process-math">\(\mu\alpha\gamma\nu\acute{\eta}\tau\eta\varsigma\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\acute{\iota}\theta o \varsigma\)</span> meaning stones from magnesia. <em class="emphasis">Magnetis [l√≠thos]</em> is sources of lodestones found in Manisa, Turkey. Magnetism is caused by moving charges and is experienced by moving charges. It is a phenomenon of materials by which they attract or repel other materials. The motion of an electron in a orbit around a nucleus or its spin on an axis produces a magnetic field. [Note the magnetic field due to spin motion of an electron is some kind of intrinsic phenomenon of electron which constitutes magnetic dipole moment of the electron. Quantum electrodynamics explains the reason of magnetic dipole moment of electron, but it is not very simple to explain here.]</div>
