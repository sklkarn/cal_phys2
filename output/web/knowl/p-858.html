<div class="para">Consider a plane wave progressing towards a smooth surface, like glass or mirror as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ref1.html" title="Figure 5.2.2.(a)">Figure 5.2.2.(a)</a>. A light ray, AO perpendicular to the wavefronts is making an angle of incidence, i with the normal, N. The side, X of the progressing wavefront, XY has just made contact with the surface of the mirror. While Y is moving the distance, vt, a secondary wavelet emanates from X and also travels the distance, vt. At the end of the time interval, t, Y will have just made contact with the surface, at the point Y’. The new reflected wavefront is found from Huygens’s principle by drawing the new wave front such that it touches the point Y’ and is tangent to the secondary wavelet from X. The point of tangency is called X’. The new wavefront is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ref1.html" title="Figure 5.2.2.(a)">Figure 5.2.2.(a)</a> as the blue line X’Y’.  The wave is said to have been reflected. The new reflected ray, OB is drawn perpendicular to the wavefront, X’Y’. The rest of the reflected wavefronts are drawn parallel to X’Y’ and perpendicular to ray, OB. The reflected ray, OB makes an angle r is called the <em class="emphasis">angle of reflection</em>, with the normal, N. Because the incident ray, AO is perpendicular to the wavefront, XY, the angle that the wavefront, XY makes with the surface is the same as the angle of incidence, i. This can be seen by looking at triangle, <span class="process-math">\(\bigtriangleup XEO\text{.}\)</span> The sum of all the angles in triangle, XEO must equal <span class="process-math">\(180^{o}\text{,}\)</span> and consider <span class="process-math">\(\angle EXO = \theta,\)</span> then</div>

<div class="para">Which proves the second law of reflection and it says that the angle of incidence i is equal to the angle of reflection r. The first law of reflection was implied in the derivation and it says that the incident ray, the normal, and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane. We have derived the law of reflection by Huygens’s principle and the wave nature of light. Having thus established the law, we can simplify the procedure for its use by drawing the ray diagram as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ref3.html" title="Figure 5.2.2.(b)">Figure 5.2.2.(b)</a> where the faint blue plane is an imaginary plane which contains the incident ray, (OA), the normal, (ON), and the reflected ray, (OB).</div>
