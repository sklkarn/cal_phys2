<div class="para">When two or more waves interact simultaneously at any particle in a medium, the resultant displacement of the particle at that instant is given by the superposition of all these waves. After the superposition from the region of overlapping these waves emerge as if they have not interfered at all. Each wave retains its individual characteristics and behaves as if others were not there. This behavior is known as <dfn class="terminology">principle of superposition</dfn>. The principle of superposition states that when two or more waves meet at a point, the total displacement is the vector sum of the displacements that each individual wave would cause at that point.</div>
