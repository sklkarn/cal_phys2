<div class="para">Energy propagates two ways in water one way is due to vertical up and down motion of water surface and another way is a back and forth motion of water molecules inside the water. Similar to concentric circles on water surface energy transmitted in space in the form of concentric spheres. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ripples2.html" title="Figure 4.2.1.(b)">FigureÂ 4.2.1.(b)</a> shows the same disturbances traveling away from the center as a series of successive <em class="emphasis">wavefronts</em> labeled crests and troughs. A wavefront is a locus of points along which all phases and displacements are identical. The solid circles depict the outward-moving wave crests; the dashed circles represent wave troughs. Adjacent crests are always a wavelength apart, as are the adjacent troughs.</div>
