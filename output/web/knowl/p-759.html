<div class="para">It is a kind of energy which is produced when medium vibrates. It is a mechanical wave and creates pressure on a layer of medium when propagates, hence it is also called a pressure wave. Sound wave is longitudinal in nature. When such energy reaches to animal eardrum, it begins to vibrate and animal has sensation of hearing. The physical character of sound depends upon the listener’s audible perception. The physical quantity that defines the loudness is a sound pressure and the quantity that defines the timbre or quality of sound is a frequency, f, measured in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). A sound of frequency 20 Hz to 20 kHz is audible to healthy human ear. Loudness increases with the increase of pressure amplitude at a given frequency.  <dfn class="terminology">Loudness or Intensity Level</dfn> is a sound energy received by a unit area of listener’s eardrum (detector) in unit time. Loudness is a listener’s perception. <dfn class="terminology">Intensity</dfn> is an energy carried by a  wave per unit area per unit time. Intensity is a property of sound producing device. Loudness is an intensity received by a listener.</div>
