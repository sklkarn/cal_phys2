<dfn class="terminology">Charging by Induction:</dfn> In this method an uncharged object is brought near a charged object (no physical contact) to induce a positive and negative charge on it. When charged object is in proximity of uncharged object it produces an electrical force on electrons to move them from one part of object to another. When an insulator is brought near a charged object electrons of insulator atoms experience electrical force which stretches atoms to  displace center of gravity of positive charges and negative charges. This phenomenon of separation of charges is called <em class="emphasis">polarization</em>. Hence in induction positive charges are separated from negative charges to produce charges on an object.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="subsec-charg_transf.html#li-11" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
