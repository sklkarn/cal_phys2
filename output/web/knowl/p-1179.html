All the secondary waves from slit when reach the point P then point P will be of maximum or minimum intensity depending on the path difference between them originating from the corresponding points of the wavefront on slit.

\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">where a is the width of the slit and BL is the path difference between secondary waves originating from points A and B. If <span class="process-math">\(BL = \lambda\text{,}\)</span> then point P will be a point of minimum intensity. To understand this concept divide the  wavefront into two halves AC and BC and if the path difference between the secondary waves from A and B is <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\text{,}\)</span> then path difference between the secondary waves from point A and C will be <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\lambda}{2}\text{.}\)</span> Similarly from every point in the upper half AC there is a corresponding point in the lower half BC and the path difference between the secondary waves from these points is  <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\lambda}{2}\text{.}\)</span> Thus, destructive interference takes place and the point P will be of minimum intensity. If <span class="process-math">\(BL=2\lambda\text{,}\)</span> then also the point where they meet on the screen will be of minimum intensity. To understand this concept the wavefront AB now can be divided into four quarters. The secondary waves from first quarter meet on that from second quarter on screen in opposite phase, i.e. in <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\lambda}{2}\)</span> path difference and cancel out each other. Hence the point on screen will be of minimum intensity. In general for secondary minima</div>
