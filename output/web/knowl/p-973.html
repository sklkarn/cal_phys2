<div class="para">In greek chroma means color and aberration means defect, hence the color defects of a lens is called a chromatic aberration. In other words, the inability of a lens to focus all colors of white light at a single focus is known as chromatic aberration. From lens maker’s formula it is clear that the focal length of a lens depend upon the refractive index of a material of lens which is the cause of chromatic aberration. If white light is passing through the lens violet color focuses at a point <span class="process-math">\(F_{v}\)</span> near to the lens and the red color focuses at point <span class="process-math">\(F_{r}\)</span> far from the lens. The rays of intermediate colors are focused between these points as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/chrom_abrl.html" title="Figure 5.3.5">Figure 5.3.5</a>. Hence the image of an object emitting white light stretched between <span class="process-math">\(F_{v}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F_{r}\)</span> and is blurred. Chromatic aberration is of two types, axial (or longitudinal) aberration and lateral (or transverse) aberration.</div>
