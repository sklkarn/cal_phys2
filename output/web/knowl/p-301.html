<div class="para">To understand internal resistance and emf lets consider a lead-acid cell. However, the similar senario could be applied for any other alkaline cells. In lead - acid cell dilute <span class="process-math">\(H_{2} SO_{4}\)</span> has been used as an electrolyte which gets dissociated in <span class="process-math">\(H^{+}\)</span> ions and <span class="process-math">\(SO_{4}^{--}\)</span> ions in aquous environment as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PbCell.html" title="Figure 2.3.2.(a)">FigureÂ 2.3.2.(a)</a>. Now <span class="process-math">\(H^{+}\)</span> ion migrates towards <span class="process-math">\(PbO_{2} \)</span> electrode, captures electron from the electrode and becomes nacent hydrogen atom. Nacent <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> then reacts with <span class="process-math">\(PbO_{2}\)</span> and forms <span class="process-math">\(H_{2}O\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(PbO\text{.}\)</span>  <span class="process-math">\(PbO\)</span> instantly reacts with <span class="process-math">\(H_{2} SO_{4}\)</span> molecule and converted into <span class="process-math">\(PbSO_{4}\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(+ve\)</span> charges start accumulating on <span class="process-math">\(PbO_{2} \)</span> electrode, we call it a <span class="process-math">\(+ \)</span> plate of the cell.</div>
