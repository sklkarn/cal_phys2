<div class="para">It’s unit is Ampere, i.e. one ampere of current represents one coulomb of charge passes through a conductor in one second. It is a scalar quantity but it’s conventional direction of motion is taken as the direction of flow of positive charges. In a conductor current flows solely due to the motion of electrons, hence the direction of current is opposite to electron-flow. From the law of conservation of charges current remains constant in a conductor irrespective of the local area of cross-section. When the direction of motion of charge does not change with time, the current is said to be a <dfn class="terminology">direct current, or DC</dfn>, but when the direction of charge motion reverses periodically, the current is known as <dfn class="terminology">alternating current, or AC</dfn>.</div>
