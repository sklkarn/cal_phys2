<div class="para">A rainbow is an optical phenomenon, which is produced in the sky due to the combined effect of refraction, internal reflection, and dispersion of light in water droplets. A rainbow consists of the primary rainbow and the secondary rainbow. The primary (main) rainbow is caused by two refractions and one internal reflection inside a rain droplet. The secondary rainbow appears outside the primary one and is caused by two refractions and two internal reflections inside the spherical water droplet. The colors of the secondary rainbow are reversed from the primary bow, and the secondary bow is twice as broad.</div>
