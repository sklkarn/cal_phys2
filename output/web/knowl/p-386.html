<div class="para">Most of the forces a magnet exerts comes from its ends. Hence magnet possesses two poles at its two ends. If a magnet is pivoted at its center in such a way that it can swing freely, then it always comes to at rest by pointing one of its ends towards north and the other towards south direction. The north-pointing end is called a <em class="emphasis">North-Seeking</em> or <dfn class="terminology">N pole</dfn> and the south-pointing end is called <dfn class="terminology">S Pole</dfn> or <em class="emphasis">South-Seeking</em>. Like poles repel and unlike poles attract. North and south poles always exist in pairs (there are no magnetic monopoles in nature), so if one were to split a permanent magnet in half, two smaller magnets would be created, each with a north pole and south pole. Even if one cut a magnet into pieces all the way down to a single atom they still get a N pole and a S pole because of orbiting electron as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/barmagnet.html" title="Figure 3.1.3.(a)">FigureÂ 3.1.3.(a)</a>. There is no such thing as a single free magnetic pole.</div>
