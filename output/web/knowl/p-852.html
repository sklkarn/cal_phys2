<div class="para">Consider a source, S as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Wfront.html" title="Figure 5.1.2">Figure 5.1.2</a>(a) which is sending out light in the form of waves in all directions. If v be the velocity of  propagation of the wave then at time, t, all the particles of the medium on the surface, xy will be vibrating in phase. Hence, xy is a portion of the sphere of radius, vt with center, S. The surface, xy is called a wavefront. A <dfn class="terminology">wavefront</dfn> is a locus of all the points of the medium which are vibrating in phase in every interval of time. If the distance is small then wavefront takes shape of a source such as point source emits spherical wavefronts and line source emits cylindrical wavefronts but if the source is at a large distance, then any small portion of the wavefront can be considered as plane wavefront as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Wfront.html" title="Figure 5.1.2">Figure 5.1.2</a>(b). The radius of wavefront is considered as ray of light. Thus rays of light diverging from or converging to a point give rise to a spherical wavefront and a parallel beam of light gives rise to a plane wavefront. According to Huygens, every point on the primary wavefront (1, 2, 3, etc.,) behaves as the secondary source of light. These secondary waves are called wavelets that travel in space with the same velocity as the original wave and the envelope of the all the secondary wavelets after given interval of time gives rise to a secondary wavefront. As the secondary wavelets are spherical  this would lead to backward propagation of the wave. In time, t’ the secondary waves travel a distance, vt’ with points (1, 2, 3, etc.) being their centers. Hence the envelope <span class="process-math">\(x_{1}y_{1}\)</span> is a secondary wavefront and  <span class="process-math">\(x_{2}y_{2}\)</span> is a backward wavefront. Now according to Huygens principle only  forward wavefronts are plausible not the backward wavefront. The rear envelope of these wavelets is shown by <span class="process-math">\(x_{2}y_{2}\)</span> which cannot represent the next wavefront after the time, t. This can be explained using Stoke’s law. According to this law, the amplitude at each point of the secondary wave is proportional to <span class="process-math">\((1+\cos\theta)\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\theta \)</span> is the angle between the wave normal (<span class="process-math">\(Sx \)</span> or, <span class="process-math">\(Sy\)</span>) and the direction of propagation which is the line, joining the point of the secondary wave to its centre. For the backward wavefront, <span class="process-math">\(\theta=\pi\text{.}\)</span>

\therefore \quad (1+\cos\theta) =(1+\cos\pi) =0.

<div class="para">Hence no effect of secondary wavelets is observed in the backward direction because amplitude is zero.</div>
