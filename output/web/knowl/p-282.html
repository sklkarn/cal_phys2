<dfn class="terminology">Drift Velocity, <span class="process-math">\(v_d\text{:}\)</span></dfn> In a metallic conductor electrons are moving randomly in a pool of positive and negative charges in all possible directions which constitute no net current. When an electric field is applied across a conductor these electrons (or charge carriers) begin to flow in one particular direction giving rise to current in a conductor. During the motion these electrons interact with residual positively charged atoms and other electrons which change their motion in a zig-zag path resulting a longer time to reach at the other end of the conductor. The  average velocity with which these electrons can move inside the conductor in presence of electric field is called a <em class="emphasis">drift velocity</em>. We will know latter that the drift velocity does not depend on length or area of cross-section of a conductor.</div>
