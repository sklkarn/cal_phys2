<div class="para"> Transformer is an electrical appliance which convert large current at low voltage to low current at high voltage, and vice versa. It uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to transform electrical energy from one circuit to another. The AC power is more preferential over dc power as it can be transmitted at high voltage and low currents with significantly small power loss</div>

<div class="para">and can be subsequently transformed to modest voltage and larger currents near destination with the help of transformer. It can transform power into large variety of voltage and currents by using step-up, or step-down transformer with desired numbers of turns at primary and secondary coils. It can also be used as impedance matching device in order to get maximum power transfer [read <a href="subsec-maxptr.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 2.3.3: Maximum Power Transfer Theorem">SubsectionÂ 2.3.3</a>] from generator to load. It can also be used as ac coupling between two circuits that are not from the same dc potential.</div>
