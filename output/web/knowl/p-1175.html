<div class="para">Light waves have very small wavelength from <span class="process-math">\(4\times10^{-7}\,m\)</span> mto <span class="process-math">\(7 \times 10^{-7}\, m\text{.}\)</span> If the size of opening or obstacle is near to this limit, then only diffraction takes place. Huygens wavelets theory with the help of principle of interference can explain satisfactorily the bending effect of light around the obstacles. Diffraction phenomena can be divided into two types: <em class="emphasis">Fresnel diffraction</em> and <em class="emphasis">Fraunhofer diffraction</em>. In Fresnel class, the source and the screen  are taken at finite distances from the aperture or obstacle. In Fraunhofer class, the source and the screen  are taken virtually at infinite distances from the aperture or obstacle. The incoming light is rendered parallel with a lens and the diffracted beam is focused on the screen with another lens.  Fresnel diffraction does not require any lens. A plane wavefront is considered in Fraunhofer diffraction. We discuss here only Fraunhoffer type diffraction.</div>
