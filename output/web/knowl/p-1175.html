<div class="para">We may have seen a geometrical shadow around the bright spot when the light coming through a hole falls on a screen. If the size of hole is decreased gradually, the brightness also spreads over the geometrical shadow region, which could not be explained on the basis of geometrical optics. Such phenomenon of bending of light around the corners of a narrow aperture or obstacle and spreading of light waves into geometrical shadow is called <dfn class="terminology">diffraction</dfn>. It is also a superposition of two light waves just as in case of interference. The difference is that when two wavefronts from coherent sources are superimposed interference takes place but when two secondary wavelets of a same wavefront superimpose diffraction takes place. Hence two coherent sources are mandatory for interference pattern but only one source is sufficient enough to produce diffraction pattern. Thus diffraction is a superposition of two or more secondary wavelets. The diffraction phenomena can only be explained on the basis of wave theory of light.</div>
