<dfn class="terminology">Atomic Structure:</dfn> All substances are made up of atoms and every atom consists of nucleus at its core which is surrounded by fast revolving electron/s (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig1.html" title="Figure 1.0.2">Figure 1.0.2</a>). The nucleus consists of two different types of elementary particles, protons and neutrons. Protons and neutrons together are called <dfn class="terminology">nucleons</dfn> as they reside inside a nucleus. Neutron does not have any charge but proton has positive charge. Charge on proton and electron is same but opposite in nature. Since nucleus has <span class="process-math">\(+ve\)</span> charge and electron has <span class="process-math">\(-ve\)</span> charge the net charge on an atom is zero. Mass of proton is nearly same as the mass of neutron but electron is much less massive in comparison to them. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/table1.html" title="Table 1.0.3: ">Table 1.0.3</a> summarizes the relative mass, actual mass, and charge on proton, neutron, and electron. Total number of protons present in a nucleus is  called an <em class="emphasis">atomic number</em>.  In an atom,</div>
