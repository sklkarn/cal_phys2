<div class="para">A typical transformer [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/transsch.html" title="Figure 3.9.13.(a)">Figure 3.9.13.(a)</a>] consists of a two or more coils of insulated wire wound on a laminated iron core. An alternating voltage which is to be reduced or increased is connected to the coil, called the <dfn class="terminology">primary coil</dfn> or input coil. This coil magnetizes the iron core. A voltage is then induced in the other coil, called the <dfn class="terminology">secondary coil</dfn> or output coil. The change of voltage (or voltage ratio) between the primary and secondary depends on the turns ratio of the two coils. There are two types of transformer on the basis of their operation. If the number of turns in primary coil is less than that at secondary then it is called a <em class="emphasis">step-up</em> transformer [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/transform3.html" title="Figure 3.9.13.(b)">Figure 3.9.13.(b)</a>] and if number of turns in primary is grater than that in secondary then it is called a <em class="emphasis">step down</em> transformer [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/transform.html" title="Figure 3.9.13.(c)">Figure 3.9.13.(c)</a>].</div>
