<dfn class="terminology">Conservative Force:</dfn> It is a force which is directed along a certain fixed point. Workdone by these force around a closed path is always zero. Gravitational force, electric force, elastic spring force, are some examples of conservative forces. <dfn class="terminology">Non-conservative force:</dfn> It is a force which change its direction depends upon the object motion. Workdone by these force around a closed path is always non-zero. Frictional force, viscous force, air drag force or any kind of resistive forces are non-conservative forces.</div>
