<div class="para">Let current I is flowing through a circuit C [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/selfind.html" title="Figure 3.7.4">FigureÂ 3.7.4</a>]. This current will set up a magnetic field and hence a magnetic flux <span class="process-math">\(\Phi\)</span> is linked with the circuit. As the magnetic field at any point is proportional to the current flowing through the circuit, the magnetic flux <span class="process-math">\(\Phi\)</span> linked to the circuit at any instant is also proportional to the current I flowing through it at the same instant. For any geometry of loop, the magnetic flux through the loop, produced by the current in the loop is <span class="process-math">\(\Phi \propto I\)</span>
