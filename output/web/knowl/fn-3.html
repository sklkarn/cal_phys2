<em class="emphasis">Fields:</em> A field is a region of space whose every point defines some kind of physical quantities. Depending upon the nature of physical quantity there are two types of field, scalar field and vector field. A force field defines a force vector at every location in space. A magnetic field defines a magnetic field vector at every location in space. A potential energy field defines a potential energy at every location in space. The gravitational field is a vector field which expresses the value of gravitational force, and Higgâ€™s field is a scalar field which defines the mass or energy of a particle. If <span class="process-math">\(\phi (x,y,z)\)</span> is a scalar function associated with every point (x,y,z) of any region in space, then the region is defined as a scalar field. Again, if <span class="process-math">\(\vec{V}(x,y,z)\)</span> is a vector associated with every point (x,y,z) of any region in space, then the region is defined as a vector field.</div>
