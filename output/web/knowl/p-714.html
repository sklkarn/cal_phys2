<dfn class="terminology">Ratio of Specific Heat Capacities, <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{:}\)</span></dfn> The specific heat capacity is a material property which defines heat absorbing capacity of a unit mass of material for unit rise of temperature. From first law of thermodynamics,</div>

<div class="para">when heat is supplied to the gas at constant volume it increases its internal energy but by doing so  pressure of the gas also increases. When gas is heated at constant pressure it not only increases its internal energy but it also expands hence the system (gas) has to do extra work on the surrounding. The energy needed for expansion is taken from the internal energy of the gas. To compensate such work and have the same increase in internal energy as at constant volume some additional heat must be absorbed by the system at constant pressure. Hence the gas has two specific heat capacities, called specific heat at constant volume, <span class="process-math">\(c_{v}\)</span> and specific heat at constant pressure, <span class="process-math">\(c_{p}.\)</span> The ratio of these two heat capacities is defined as <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> i.e.,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\gamma = \frac{c_{p}}{c_{v}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">On the other hand, Solid and liquid are considered as an incompressible material hence their specific heat capacities at constant volume and pressure have almost the same value hence they have only one specific heat capacity.
