<div class="para">It is not possible to have interference due to two independent sources of light because they are not similar to each other and can not maintain a constant phase difference. To have a sustained interference the two waves must be coherent (i.e., they have same wavelength, amplitude, and in a constant phase difference), and must be moving nearly parallel to each other. Since the wavelength of light is extremely small (of the order of <span class="process-math">\(10^{-5}\, cm\)</span>), the two sources must be narrow and very close to each other.</div>
