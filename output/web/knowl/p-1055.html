<div class="para">Once the light from objects falls on the retina after getting refracted from the crystalline lens and vitrous humor, retina changes the light signal into electrical signal and transmits this signal to the brain via optic nerve where brain realizes the image of the object. The eye lens is designed in such a way that it forms the image of object situated at different distances from the eye. The mechanism of crystalline lens to focus the light coming from  objects at different distance to the retina is called an <dfn class="terminology">accommodation</dfn>. When object is near to the eye its focal length has to be smaller and lens has to be thicker to focus the light on retina and when an object is very far away from the eye lens, then its focal length has to be longer and lens has to be thinner to focus the light onto retina.</div>
