<div class="para">Eye is an optical device endowed to us to perceive the beautiful nature. It is nearly spherical in shape of diameter about 2.3 cm. The front portion of eye is slightly bulges out and is covered with transparent tough membrane called <em class="emphasis">cornea</em>. Behind cornea  it has liquid called <em class="emphasis">aqueous humor</em>. Next to it is a diaphragm called <em class="emphasis">iris</em> with a hole at its center called <em class="emphasis">pupi</em>l. Behind iris there is a crystalline lens which is mounted on a <em class="emphasis">ciliary muscles</em>.  Inside eye ball is filled with liquid called <em class="emphasis">vitreous humor</em>. The image is formed on the innermost light sensitive membrane called <em class="emphasis">retina</em>. The pupil is just like a shutter in camera which allow the sufficient amount of light to enter into the eye. The pupil takes sometime to readjust its size to allow how much light permits to enter the eye,  this is the reason when you go from sunny day outside to the relatively dark room like cinema hall nothing is visible  for a while but gradually everything becomes clear after sometime.</div>
