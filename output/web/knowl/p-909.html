<div class="para">When a ray of light passes from an optically denser medium to the rare medium it bends away from the normal. If the angle of incidence in this case is increased gradually then at particular angle of incidence the refracted ray starts grazing on the surface separating two media i.e., angle of refraction becomes <span class="process-math">\(90^{o}\text{.}\)</span> The angle of incidence at that condition is called a <dfn class="terminology">critical angle, c</dfn>. If the angle of incidence is further increased above the critical angle then the light ray returns into the same denser medium, such phenomenon is called the <dfn class="terminology">total internal reflection</dfn>. Since the reflection happen at a very top thin surface of interface and it is assumed that there is no loss of energy in the form of transmission or absorption, hence the name total internal reflection.  Starting from angle of incidence <span class="process-math">\(i=0,\)</span> angle of refraction <span class="process-math">\(r=0\)</span> as i increases r also increases if the ray of light is going from denser to a rare medium as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tir.html" title="Figure 5.2.25">Figure 5.2.25</a>. When  <span class="process-math">\(i=c,\)</span> (the critical angle) then the angle of refraction,  <span class="process-math">\(r=90^{o}\text{.}\)</span> Hence from Snell’s law</div>
