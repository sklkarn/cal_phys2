<div class="para">Suppose we want to store some more charge on it then we have to reduce its potential somehow before putting any charge. So another isolated conductor B is brought near A then A induces negative charges on the inner surface of B and positive charges on the outer surface as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/paralleplate1.html" title="Figure 1.7.5.(a)">Figure 1.7.5.(a)</a>. The negative charge on B tends to reduce the potential of A and positive charge on B tends to increase potential of A. Since negative charges of B are closer to A than the positive charges of B the net potential of A is reduced by some amount. This slight decrees in potential of A results increase of capacitance of A because of relation</div>

<div class="para">remaining Q constant. Hence a more charge can be stored on the same conductor till the potential again reaches to  V.  The capacitance can be considerably high if the conductors are placed very close to each other and a conductor B is grounded (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/paralleplate.html" title="Figure 1.7.5.(b)">Figure 1.7.5.(b)</a>).
