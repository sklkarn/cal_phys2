<div class="para">A physical world can be described by using varieties of physical quantities, they are a <dfn class="terminology">scalar physical quantity</dfn> (or, simply  <em class="emphasis">scalars</em>) and a <dfn class="terminology">vector physical quantity</dfn> (or, simply <em class="emphasis">vectors</em>). A <em class="alert">scalar</em> quantity has only magnitude (size), e.g., mass, length, time, volume, density, work, speed, temperature, potential, current, resistance, flux, power, intensity, etc. and a <em class="alert">vector</em> quantity has both magnitude and direction, e.g., velocity, acceleration, displacement, momentum, force, weight, torque, impulse, moment, current density, etc. A quantity like surface area is a scalar in general, but when considered with its specific orientation, it is taken as a vector quantity. In physics, when area comes with any vector quantity in a mathematical operation it is considered as a vector. For instance, flux is a dot product of two vectors, one of them is an area. Area has a direction which is always taken as an outward normal to the surface. Mathematically, division of a vector with another vector is undefined, hence pressure is considered as a scalar even if it is defined as a force per unit area. <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>
