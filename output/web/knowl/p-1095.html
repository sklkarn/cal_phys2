<div class="para">The branch of optics which deals with the measurement of light energy is called photometry. Light is either reflected by the object or is emitted by it. Most of the objects are seen when it reflects light, such as wall, book, moon, etc. Objects like lamp, stars, sun, etc. can be seen when it emits its own light. To protect eye from light strain, some standard of illumination must be set. Hence, it is necessary to measure the quantity of light emitted by a source as well as the amount of light reflecting from some surface. The classroom illumination of 250  lumens per square meter (or, lux) should be preferable, whereas operation theater should be preferable to about 1000 lumens per square meter (or, lux).</div>
