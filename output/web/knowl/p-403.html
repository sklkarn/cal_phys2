<div class="para">The positive ions produced from a source at the center are accelerated by a dee which is at the negative potential at that moment. Due to the presence of magnetic field (pointed into the page) the ions will move in a circular path inside the dees. The magnetic field and the frequency of applied voltage are so adjusted that as the ion comes out of a dee, the dees change their polarity (+ve dee becomes -ve and vice-versa) and the ion is further accelerated and moves with higher  velocity along a circular path of greater radius as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cyclotron.html" title="Figure 3.1.11">FigureÂ 3.1.11</a>.  Once the ion reaches to the periphery of the dees it gets deflected out from the dees to bombard a target.</div>
