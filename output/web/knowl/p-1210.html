<div class="para">Ordinary light waves after passing through crystal A become polarized as their all vibrations filter except the one which is parallel to the crystal (optic) axis. Hence crystal A is also called polarizer and crystal B is called analyzer. The plane of polarization consists no vibrations. The plane in which vibrations are confined after passing through the polarizer is called the plane of vibration, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/polr4a.html" title="Figure 5.8.19">Figure 5.8.19</a>. Ordinary light may consist of large number of wavelengths and vibrations may be linear, circular, or elliptical. Circular or elliptical vibrations consist of two linear vibrations which are perpendicular to each other. The vibrations parallel to plane of the paper are shown as arrow heads and that perpendicular to the plane of paper are shown as dots in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/polr4a.html" title="Figure 5.8.19">Figure 5.8.19</a>.</div>
