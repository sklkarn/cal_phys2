<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> is a resistivity of the material of transmission line, L is its length, and A is its area of cross-section. Hence to make R small wire should be made thicker (or A is high) but in this case transmission line becomes heavier and costly. Another way is to make V as high as possible and I as small as possible so that</div>

<div class="para">i.e., new power loss <span class="process-math">\(P"\)</span> is a million times smaller than power loss of <span class="process-math">\(P'\text{.}\)</span> To convert voltage or current from high to low or from low to high is only possible with the help of transformer which can only be operated in alternating current under the electromagnetic induction. Hence ac is preferential over dc.</div>
