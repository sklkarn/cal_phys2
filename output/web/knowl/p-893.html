<em class="alert">Note:</em> Optically denser and rare has nothing to do with the density of the medium which is sometimes misunderstood. However, refractive index of a medium is proportional to the density of that medium. As the temperature increases the density of the medium decreases generally and so is its refractive index. For example, water has density of <span class="process-math">\(1\,g/ml\)</span> and  refractive index of <span class="process-math">\(1.3235\)</span> whereas isopropyle alcohol has density of <span class="process-math">\(0.785\,g/ml\)</span> and  refractive index of <span class="process-math">\(1.3772\)</span> it means light bend more in alcohol then in water. The refractive index of vacuum is 1 and that for air is 1.0003 hence they are taken as same.  When a ray is incident on the surface separating two media it either bends towards or away from the normal at the point of incidence. If light goes from rare to denser it bends towards the normal and if it goes from denser to rare it bends away from the normal. The angle between initial direction of light to the final direction in the second medium is known as angle of deviation, <span class="process-math">\(\delta\text{.}\)</span>
