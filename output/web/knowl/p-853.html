<div class="para">Geometric optics is based on the principle of rectilinear propagation of light in which light is considered as a ray which travels in a straight line. Anything which radiates or emits light is known as object. Objects that emit light on their own are called luminous (or <em class="emphasis">self-luminous</em>) objects such as sun, stars, light bulb etc. Objects that do not emit or reflect light are known as <em class="emphasis">non-luminous</em> objects such as wood, plastics, metals etc. Luminous object can either emits light or reflect light from another source such as moon, mirror, etc. An object which has no physical extent is called a point object and an object which has length, width, and height is known as <em class="emphasis">extended object</em>. An image on the other hand is an apparent replica of an object. A line which is normal to the wavefronts of the actual light along which energy flow is known as <dfn class="terminology">ray of light</dfn>. A collection of rays of light is known as <dfn class="terminology">beam</dfn>. A collection of parallel rays of light is known as  <dfn class="terminology">parallel beam</dfn>, rays converging to a point is known as  <dfn class="terminology">convergent beam</dfn>, and rays diverging from a point is known as  <dfn class="terminology">divergent beam</dfn>.</div>
