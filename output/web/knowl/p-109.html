<div class="para">Thus the electric field at any point close to the surface of a charged conductor of any shape is equal to <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{o}}\)</span> times the surface charge density <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> is positive, electric field is directed away from the conductor and if it is negative, then field is directed towards the conductor. Obviously field near a plane conductor is twice of the field in front of a non-conducting thin sheet of charge.</div>
