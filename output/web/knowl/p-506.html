<div class="para">Eddy currents can also be removed by cracks or slits in the conductor, which break the circuit and prevent the current loops from circulating. This means that eddy currents can be used to detect defects in materials. This is called nondestructive testing and is often used in airplanes. The magnetic field produced by the eddy currents is measured, where a change in the field reveals the presence of an irregularity; a defect will reduce the size of the eddy current, which in turn reduces the magnetic field strength.</div>
