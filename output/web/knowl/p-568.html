<div class="para">When lower arm of the loop enters into external magnetic field flux starts increasing in the loop and hence loop induces its current in such a way that it could oppose that change. Consequently, loop induced magnetic field, <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B}_{ind} \)</span> just opposite to external magnetic field, <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B} \text{.}\)</span> Meaning if external field <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B}\)</span> is pointed into the page then induced field <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B}_{ind}\)</span> by the loop is pointed out of the page. Now from <em class="emphasis">Right Hand Thumb</em> rule the induced current, I  in the loop must be counterclockwise.
