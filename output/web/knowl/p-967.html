<div class="para">The dispersive powers of different materials are different. The dispersive power of a flint glass prism is higher than that of a crown glass prism hence angular dispersion produced by the flint glass prism is greater than that by the crown glass prism of the same refracting angle. If the materials and the angle of the prisms are so adjusted  that the dispersion produced by the first prism is equal and opposite to that produced by the second prism, then the final beam will be deviated but not dispersed for the white light. Such a combination of the two prisms will produce deviation in the incident beam without dispersion.</div>
