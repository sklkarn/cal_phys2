<div class="para">This photometer is used to compare the luminous intensities of the two sources or to calculate the luminous intensity of the unknown source by comparing that with the known source. It consists of a piece of white paper with grease spot at its center lies in between the two sources whose luminous intensities are to be compared. The two sources on the optical bench are so adjusted that the grease spot becomes indistinguishable from the rest of the paper.</div>
