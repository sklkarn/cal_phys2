<div class="para">On the other hand, when a wave pulse travels along a string with a free end (one end of string attached to a ring that is free to slide along a pole) and when the wave reaches to the free end at its maximum displacement both wave and string come to at rest for a moment. During this time string is stretched to highest value and applies a maximum tension on string due to which string gets pulled back down which constitutes a reflected wave pulse but in the same phase as incident wave pulse. When they overlap the amplitude of pulse increased by double as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/freep.html" title="Figure 4.4.4">FigureÂ 4.4.4</a>. The total displacement of overlapping wave pulses is an algebraic sum of their displacement in individual pulses.</div>
