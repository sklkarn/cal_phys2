<div class="para">Echoes are also the effect of reflection of sound waves perceived by the ear. When a reflected sound wave reaches the ear after 0.1 seconds of the original sound was heard then  echoes are produced. If the elapsed time between the arrivals of the two sound waves is more than 0.1 seconds, then the sensation of the first sound will have died out. In other words, echo is a sensation of second sound wave after the effect of original sound wave will vanish. It is not a prolonging of the original sound wave as in reverberation.</div>
